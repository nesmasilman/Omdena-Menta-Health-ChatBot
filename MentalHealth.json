Also I'm feeling more careless day by day and losing basic patience in everyday tasks, feeling useless and stressed each and everyday. Its not like im alone, I have a girlfriend and I go to class everyday meeting my 3-4 friends and having a great time but even they can notice how low my mental capacity has reached unable to figure out basic mental math and what not, I can feel things but still feel cold and tasteless  \nis there anything i can do to improve this in anyway, im just nervous and lost",

        "body": "We’ve been together a while and he’d opened up about trauma he’s suffered through childhood pretty much from the beginning which I believe are the roots of his behaviour. He’s also opened up about his alcoholism and depression. He is fully aware of his problems but is struggling to take action to help himself. He has mentioned about going to AA meetings but it’s a cycle of saying he wants to help himself to then self destruct. And it gets worse when any good things happens in his life, as if he thinks he doesn’t deserve any nice things to go his way.\n\nThe past few weeks he has really spiralled after a few changes in his life he really wanted has finally happened. Now should be a happy time. Steps have been taken to make for a better life etc, but he’s not having it and it hurts me to know that he thinks he doesn’t deserve it. He has a decent group of friends but some of them really enable his behaviours which doesn’t help his situation, which I don’t see those ones as true friends. But without family around him he only really has friends to turn to. \n\nObviously it’s not down to me to fix his problems, he has to want to, which he does but he just is struggling to take those first steps. He is not only my partner whom I love very much, he is also my best friend. What advice can you give me to help push him in the right direction and help him take control of the situation.\n\nI do not give permission for this to be posted elsewhere.\n",

        "body": "I was wondering what other people use as motivation to keep going\n\nI don't have any friends who are there if I need them, my family don't like listening or spending too much time with me, my one happy place that gave me motivation; my grandad's farm has just been sold. I don't mind school but when I get home I just can't do any homework or studying which is pretty bad considering this year is all or nothing. And to be honest I have a lot that I'm meant to be doing right now, but here I am sitting down wasting my time again because I simply don't even have the motivation to move.\nI do have a job, but that only makes me more sad and demotivated because I see all my coworkers having these amazing friendships where they're always chatting and sharing a laugh with each other, while I stand in a corner by myself because no one wants to talk. I'll get the occasional one sentence exchange if I'm lucky before they move on.\nI've never been in a relationship and I don't really have a desire to be in one anymore. I'm mentioning this because I've heard some people say that it keeps them going. \nI'm pretty boring as well. I don't like social events and because of my lack of friends, I'm never around anyone outside of work/school. Like you could say hello to me I would probably keep thinking back to that moment for a week or 2.\n\nAnyway, tldr: Nothing achievable exites me anymore therefore I don't have have a sliver of motivation for anything in life.",

        "body": "**TW: SA, Physical/Emotional Abuse, Dr*g Abuse, Divorce, Mental Illness\n\nIn 2022, my ex “fiancé” (he gave me a promise ring and “we” decided to call it an engagement ring bc he’d get mad if I said no) of four one-and-off abusive years and I broke up on 4th of July weekend. He put all of my stuff, some that he broke too, in garbage bags while telling me no man will ever want me but him because I’m worthless. I drove from our apartment we shared and I saw fireworks in the sky on my way back to my parent’s house.\n\nI got back in the wrong crowd again, drinking so much I’d snort to keep from blacking out. My group of “friends” gave me unlimited liquor and lines that literally never ran out. Ever. I spent the next couple weeks on bingers, putting everything in my system just to not feel a thing needing little to no sleep. After the bars closed, we would go to after parties that would last for days. This one in particular had every kind of liquor and dr*g imaginable, all available if you ask. The only rule was “No bad vibes.”\n\nI was already so gone and kept asking for more and different kinds of everything. At one point, it felt like I was just watching myself from the outside, feeling my heart break from looking at myself, just asking myself “What in the world am I doing? How did I get here?” Atp, everyone left except the two homeowners and my two friends. One of my friends was passed out and the other was usually all up in my face calling me her bestie but she got really quiet and stand off-ish… One homeowner took me to his room and started to r*pe me and the other walked into the room to join. They strangled me, forced me to throw up so much it hurt so bad, my privates were in excruciating pain and I “finished” and I was so ashamed of myself. Like, I’m not enjoying this, I’m extremely scared, why would my body betray me like this?\n\nI ran out, and had to wake my friend up that was passed out from the dr*gs trying to leave while I’m screaming crying. One of the r*pists hugged me and said he’s sorry and I ran out as fast as I could.\n\nBefore then, I’d already been talking to another one of my exes that treated me horribly, but I was desperate to not be alone, especially after what happened. I told him about what happened, and he instantly booked a flight to my city for a week. There goes the liquor and lines again, except he gives me so much our noses are sore and bleeding but we still keep going. He’s buying me all the things I want and buying my favorite expensive food, champagne, everything. He leaves and reality sets in. I bawl my eyes out all day. My body feels horrible from the withdrawals. All my “friends” collectively pushed me away to pretend I didn’t exist. I threw up everything I tried to eat. I couldn’t sleep and when I could I’d just have nightmares of the flashbacks just to wake up and have flashbacks all day. A literal walking nightmare.\n\nSo he flew me over to move in with him, and proposes in a month. He’s changed so much from how he used to be and he anticipates my every need and does everything my ex never did and takes me out on constant dates, getting me whatever I want with a smile never leaving my face and we’re so in love.\n\n10 months of bliss, and then my best friend dies. I was extremely angry with her at the time for stealing my car, stealing my money and for not leaving the guy who treated her so awful bc I wanted better for her. Her family hinted that he murdered her, but I had the gut feeling. I was in shock and didn’t know and thought I was fine since I couldn’t feel a thing. A few days later, we tie the knot. I’d told him previously if he yelled at me like how he did previously I was going to leave him. On our honeymoon, he screams so loud at me for an hour and scared me. Foreshadowing at its finest, right after the papers are signed.\n\nAfter the honeymoon, a week later I found out my last ex was signed into my email so great, now I have to spend the next couple weeks going in and out of the police station to file a trespassing order. My husband is screaming at me telling me this is all my fault. Around this time, it hits me, “Wow, she’s really gone.”\n\nJuggling being a newlywed with the grief and stalking would def be doable for me, for us, to lean on each other. The grieving process began for me, and he would see me cry and he would cry harder for me to comfort him. “Yeah, I understand your BEST FRIEND just got MURDERED, but there’s so much cleaning for you to do!” I’m depressed but so confused and torn, I’d think, “What happened to my knight in shining armor? Maybe he’s just stressed. He just told me he loved me, he’s just overwhelmed.”\n\nI keep telling him, “Hey, I’m really overwhelmed, and I just wanted to let you know I’m not in the best mental space. Just be patient with me.” He got angrier and angrier, but then sweet out of the blue so I thought “He’s still sweet, he’s just stressed too.” \n\nA couple weeks later, my therapist said I need a grippy sock vacation. I told my husband but “I kept my mental health from him” so he’s angry at me for that. 2 days before I go, he screams at me for an hr+ and finally says, “I’m starting to hate you and I want an annulment bc you tricked me into this marriage.” I started to collapse from crying so hard and I asked him why he did that later, “I wanted you to hurt like how you hurt me by keeping your mental health from me.”\n\nI was in PHP talking mostly abt things he’s said. They eventually told I need to go inpatient so no phone, etc. I told them I wanted to go the next day, but they said I go in like a couple hrs. So I called to let him know I was being forced to go now, and he said, “This is a lot for me to process and I cannot believe you would wait until the last minute to tell me something like this.” He hung up in my face.\n\nI spent those 3 days screaming crying about things he’s said to me and getting sedated, waking up, rinse and repeat. I finally got time to call him, “I’m driving to the dispensary gtg” “I can’t talk rn” anything just to hang up in my face.\n\nI finally made it back home, and he refused to touch, look at or talk to me saying he was so depressed he didn’t work or leave his room and he “can’t clean.” I was grabbing half-eaten bowls of food I thought was covered in mold, but it moved when I grabbed it. Gnats and flies. I’m washing dishes, trying not to throw up, and come back to bed exhausted. “You need to find somewhere else to sleep bc you can’t sleep here” after sleeping on a hospital bed w the room so cold I had to sleep with my whole body covered and I was still cold, getting waken up all times of the night by the flashlight. This was the second month of being married. Then my dad went to jail. Then my stalking ex sued me to get a restraining order against me and I had to fly back to my hometown twice from him dragging it out. My criminal lawyer said he was the only person she’d come across in her 10 year profession who got under her skin and no one does that to her, ever, and she said she’s sorry I had to go through that.\n\nFast forward 8 months to today and our divorce is next month. I had to move back in with my family and they argue every day yelling at each other. My mom always yells at my grandad for being disrespectful to her and my grandma. We think he’s starting to show signs of dementia and he’s been throwing things down, taking and hiding their stuff, and leaving them stranded and refusing to help when their cars break down, which happens a lot, and we’re in a city that isn’t known for safety. My grandma’s health is declining at an alarming rate and my mom’s too.\n\nShortly after I came back, it felt like I had a heart attack after seeing where my best friends repass was, but my insurance was at my old residence and doesn’t cover out of state. So I waited it out and ended up mostly fine. My heart palpitations were very painful and I had a LOT of trouble breathing. Like getting winded sitting up from laying down. Then I started getting really weak. I had to sleep in my grandparents bed because I couldn’t walk unassisted, but my grandad would sometimes touch me inappropriately and even started touching himself inappropriately while I was there and my grandma would sleep so close to me I was smushed up between both of them and couldn’t even turn.\n\nAfter completely losing the ability to walk, I had no choice but to stay in the hospital 9 days while my husband’s location kept showing up at a girl’s house. I was having bad heart palpitations, weakness and tremors. I had ketosis so my body was eating itself bc I could only eat a few French fries a day, and I had a very painful full-body tremor that wouldn’t stop, it felt like working out to over exertion but still working out nonstop. I had a bad allergic reaction and my IV wouldn’t work to get the Benadryl in. I ended up with stroke-level blood pressure afterwards and the meds to lower it gave me a migraine. I already had low blood pressure that was below the low level so my blood pressure was getting concerningly low after that. I also lost my ability to stand.\n\nThe rest is in the comments\n",

There is enough time for me to get my restricted before I graduate, but won't have a full license untill at least October next year. I also really want to move back home and be close to my parents but that limits my job options even more. I've also never dated anyone (and I'm turning 24 this year!) so all together I feel like I'm running out of time in life and falling way behind and I'm completely spiraling right now, I feel like I'm such a failure and I'm not sure how everything is going to work out! I feel like life is too much right now and I'm in way over my head! ",

You need to take some time and realise the pressure to have all these things in order  is coming from inside, not outside. \n\nIf you would be more comfortable living near your family, then do so. Jobs may be more limited, but they won’t be non-existent. Book some driving lessons when you’re settled and have some income (further advice is choose an instructor through reputation over price). \n\nIf you’re trying to fit your life into a niche career following university then my advice is to be a little patient and seek advice from people working in that career. Everyone will have a different story on how they ended up there. \n\nMost importantly, everything takes time. You aren’t running out of it, you just need to use it."

Years later and I still don’t have a single true friend, I have a beautiful wife who I am eternally grateful for now I just wish I could now build a support system of more than just our little party of 2. Why is it so hard? I have grown and am at a place where I no longer feel that I am too broken so why is it still so hard? Why am I still so anxious to even say I that I like a girls makeup?

        "body": "I (23M) have an online girlfriend (22F). We've known eachother for 7 years yet have only gotten together 5 months ago.\r  \n\r  \nShe has had a very traumatic past: physical, sexual and verbal abuse, got cheated on, and some other things of which I won't get into detail. Considering her past and her independancy, it's amazing how seemingly stable she is. On the surface she's a hardworking, upbeat individual that always manages to smile and emit joy, yet knowing her better than anyone she's an incredible broken person on the inside.\r  \n\r  \nBiggest problem is, she's from South-East Asia. Finding good mental health support is close to impossible, and online sources like Betterhelp are very expensive. I've talked about and looked into options with her, but realistically getting professional help is off the table, at least for now. Not to mention that the cause of her abuse comes from her father, who is all but supportive of pretty much any life choice she makes. Also I think her bills get checked, so even something like online therapy would be risky.\r  \n\r  \nThe main issue I think she has is that she doesn't recognise the severity of her own issues. If I say that she's suffering from depression she says that it's a 'strong word', same if I mention she has suffered from abuse. Yet she has depressive episodes and anxiety attacks that sometimes even cause her to self harm, something she used to do a lot more a couple of years ago, thank god, yet recently she was in such a bad state of mind, partly from her father releasing his anger on her, and partly me not being able to be there just that moment, that it caused her to self harm again. Safe to say, her issues are very serious, but she's very good at downplaying them.\r  \n\r  \nAll in all, I'm looking for some tips to be there for her in the best way possible, without having to start self-teaching myself psychology. As much as I'd want to be there for her, I can't be her therapist and her boyfriend, and also work on myself to make sure that we may meet in the future. I myself am from Europe, so it's safe to say we both have got a lot of work to do to make this work.\r  \n\r  \nI do wanna make this work, really, so that's why I came here for help. I already recommended that she should probably find other people to talk to besides me, partly because I am but one person with one perspective of life, but also because I can't always be there for her, as much as I'd love to be.\r  \n\r  \nConsidering I'm not a therapist, there's often things she says to deflect her issues that I don't know a good response to:\r  \n\r  \n\"If I say I have depression, then what? What does that change?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"How will blaming my father (or anyone else that is responsible) help anything?\"\r  \n\r  \n(there's more but I just can't think of them right now, sorry)\r  \n\r  \nAny tips/sources/help are greatly appreciated! :)\r  \n(oh and any general online dating advice is also appreciated. we most likely won't meet in at least a couple of years, so advice i'd like to know how to keep my spirits up for that long)",

Now I’m about to graduate college and still struggle to put effort into school or relationships.\n\n I feel that other people disrespected me, in school and at home.

This is a big issue and i think there are many reasons I’m always a bit on edge.\n\nI want to lash out due to my anger because I learned a long time ago that violence leads to respect from how I was treated for minor behavioral issues and how people treated me when I was hard. That’s pretty stupid though, and I don’t like those consequences.\n\nI also connected violence with love which didn’t lead to a great romantic life. All of my relationships have been terrible. I used to hate women much more and think they were evil or stupid. I think I just have trouble with personal relationships in general, men and women.\n\nI don’t mean to be a pity party because I’ve been doing better with people but it’s completely superficial.

I always thought it was sorta just either be a pushover or get respect but I am learning, slowly, that you can be soft and open and still get respect.

She and I had never even met physically, during COVID we were in the same friend group over ZOOM and developed a real connection from shared experiences and goals. We were of the same faith too.\nWhen I heard the news, my whole mind/life imploded. I was already struggling and she also had not been actively in my life for a while either. So I was shellshocked. About a week to two later I cut myself after a copious amount of whiskey and emotional numbness. \nIt happened two weeks later, then a month after that again and it has turned habitual every day. Very few in my life know quite how bad it is, they simply know I have struggled from the first few times. This is not from having a bad support group, it's me struggling not wanting to stop. \nBut I have got to a point where I can't stop. I've started cutting up the underside of my arm and wrist simply cause I wanted to know how it felt and it's the stereotype place to cut. (I started on less sensitive parts of my body and arms.) I already was getting nerve pain today while at work, and I'm worried if I decline mentally this will just go in a bad direction. Just want to get this all out and hopefully someone understands what I'm going thru \n\n:(",

I don’t know much about overdosing, so I asked if it was a lethal amount and he said he didn’t know. He started apologizing saying he made me worry for no reason and ended up listening to my advice of going to sleep.

But there is no record of any of these kids. We have tried to find any records of them what so ever and cannot. Nothing in the news. We have seen news reports about the first homicide of the year in the city where we all live, and it has come after my nephew has reported multiple friends being shot and killed in gang related violence. I want to send cards or flowers to family of these kids, but my nephew conveniently cannot provide contact info for any of these friends or their loved ones. Often, the family members allegedly die from suicide shortly after when I ask repeatedly for info about the guardians/parents. \n\nThis is not a large city by any means and typically these events are covered heavily in the news. But never my nephews affiliates. \n\nI know ALL his friends from school and none of them know any of this crew or have heard of them. He shows me messages from this gang on social media, but the only followers any of these kids ever have are my nephew and each other. I believe he controls all the accounts.\n\nHe lies a lot about other things. He has a ton of jewelry that is imitation diamonds but asserts they are genuine and gets very upset when questioned. He has many photos with prop $100 bills where you can clearly see the words “for film use only” that he gets from his school (it’s an art school). He gets VERY upset when you try to challenge the authenticity.\n\nHe is constantly getting caught in lies with us here at home and will always always double down when challenged.\n\nI don’t believe this crew really exists. I hate to question him and I want to believe him and be there for him, but his friends always die when he does poorly on an exam or quiz. It’s always the excuse for other behavior. He also always gets a premonition these kids are gonna die before they do. Every time. He sort of lays groundwork for about three days leading up to an incident. \n\nI try to play along, but I feel concerned he is believing his own stories, and guilt in not believing him. When one of these friends dies, he gets very withdrawn, but not so much that he’s crying or missing the activities he enjoys. I don’t know how to handle this. \n\nAny experience with older teens living in an imaginary world? I want to meet his needs without being dishonest. Also, what if by some crazy conspiracy it’s all true??? Then I’m a real monster. Any experience with foster kids or kids with trauma using a false reality as a coping mechanism? Is it maladaptive, or a healthy way to process grief? I feel that perhaps he doesn’t understand his own deep sadness, so he creates stories that help him normalize how he’s feeling, but I also feel at this age he can’t continue to cope in this way. \n\nAdoptive parents thru foster care found themselves unwilling to tolerate his behavior, and that’s how he ended up with us. We would have loved to have him sooner, but we are very young and were not considered candidates back when the kids were first removed. \n\nAny insight on how to be there for him greatly appreciated ",

However, I think it may just be a front, a big ole wall hiding myself from the cold truth.\n\nThe truth being that I am fucking struggling. I am struggling with socialising. I am struggling with understanding people and people understanding me, and I am fucking exhausted.\n\nNow before anyone diagnose me or ask for my diagnosis, I have none. On paper, I’m as blank as blank can be.\n\nHowever, I think I may have reached my final straw and am ready to thoroughly understand why I think, feel and act the way I do since I exited my mother’s womb.\n\nI leave my house maybe once a month because I just prefer my own companionship and honestly the outside is overwhelming. I then decide to meet new people online - since my only two best friends are normal, functioning human beings - and even that isn’t going well. In fact, meeting people online has become my final straw.\n\nThe community of people I met started off so well (now looking back at the interactions, I suppose I did put a bit of a facade to be more approachable and likeable), they made jokes, I made jokes. Until recently, my “true” self started showing and now the interactions with me (from my perspective) feels like I’m being an annoyance, unfunny, and “beggy” for lack of better words.\n\nI am too grown to be feeling like this but nothing has really changed in regards to interacting with people since I was a child, so now here I am being so emotional and crying to myself a night because I feel like a bunch of internet people don’t like me anymore. I just vehemently wish I could read people’s minds and behaviour, then I wouldn’t be second guessing every interaction I have.\n\nGreat, now I’m giving myself second hand embarrassment.\n\nAnyways, just wanted to vent to what looks like 400k+ people, such a smart move.\n\nThank you for reading 🙃",

I have nothing to compare my “now” to. Yesterday I felt like I was in a fog but did more than I have in a long time. I went out, hung out with some people, then went to the store and got back at 10 pm. Today I have felt awful. I don’t feel suicidal but I just want to crawl out of my skin and disappear. I feel very irritable and I am having “hot flashes”(im not necessarily hot, more like warm and clammy and sweating a lot). Im a little scared. Im not sure if this is going to be my normal. Is this a mood swing? In the past my mood swings usually go from numb, sad, angry, or “meh” but then again I haven’t been in touch with my emotions in a long time. I feel very much like im dissociating, almost like im a player in a game. I want to isolate and be left alone. I don’t have much of an appetite and my ED thoughts were really triggered last week and it feels like giving into them is my only option. I almost feel nauseous. I would think maybe im anxious but I’ve experienced many anxiety attacks and panic attacks and this feels very foreign. Any thoughts would be nice! Im just scared and confused and want to give in.

From encouraging her to get plastic surgery as a teenager, Forcing her 6 year old child to drink dietary tea as a supplement for weight loss, To even injecting her with botox and filler, BUT, using her own daughter as a guinea pig because she hadnt had much experience nor is licensed to do so. (keep note of this) 3 months into dating i knew i had to move her out of the abusive home. The mom popped her tire one day when my 22 year old gf decided to sleep over after a dodger game because she didnt want drink and drive. ( shed only been driving on her own for 6 months if anything) ive had her mom/bf pull a bat on me behind closed doors, even had both of them in my face on a separate occasion. the list is endless when it comes to her abusive behavior. well things were fine after moving in with me and going no contact with her family for a while. well, her wonderful mom calls her in regards to a passport. my gf HAD conservatorship over her autistic sister and the mom needed her consent to get the passport AND to drop everything she was doing at work to go get the passport which was for a trip to mexico that was an \"emergency\" but the real emergency was back at home bcuz her frail grandpa needed to see a cardiologist due to complications from his diabetes. NOPE, the mom went to Mexico instead. well she continued her shenanigans per usual and the peace was no longer. SO! revisiting her not being licensed. in doing homework i found that her mom has been doing botox, filler, fat burners etc all illegally out of home for 4 years now. the same home that has the BFs name on title of the lease. same BF whom had been aiding & abetting her illegal business for 4 years now.her BF also happens to have a nice career working in a local prison. or at least he use to. all in all. it seems like everyone is scared of this woman but not me. i reported the both of them to the state. being that the mom is on a work visa she will get deported and will be inadmissible once i testify in court. as for the BF, im sure his career will be ruined along with his reputation.

        "body": "I made a throwaway for this post.\n\nI am autistic, probably more specifically aspergers, diagnosed as the former. \n\nI seem to have a number of issues. I have always had horrific sleep, which doesn't help. I had problem binge drinking a few years ago but it's been nearly a year since I've drank anything, and over a year since I have drunk more than a can in a month. I've had cannabis twice as regular doses each, but that was 4 years ago. I was an adult a bit over the age of majority when I did. I also had a bad time through a divorce which happened when I was a teenager. My parents were still amicable but it completely devastated me for years. I completed high school but could never get through more than six months of college, done in two phases of about 3 months in each attempt. No criminal record or record of illegal drug use. \n\nBut another big issue are intrusive thoughts on a constant basis, usually tied to mature topics, like how I keep thinking of the Green Mile movie when I think of a character in anime named Kino Makoto when she is fighting, whose powers are based on violent electricity, or being unable to keep off overly complicated and unhealthy amounts of time spent to overthink things, like the Earth's destruction by the sun in seven billion years. I've even had nightmares where scientists narrate my dreams talking about it. When I get into these topics, often going from place to place with them, like how if they have these parents then they are also related to these other people, or otherwise in that line, I can end up a lot of times managing to find the darkest or sexual interpretation of things or eventually trying to repivot to something cutesy or childish but then realizing that I'm still embedded in the former kind of environment and then feel anguish of the juxtaposition of the two kinds of extremes and how they definitely should not be combined. \n\nI also have a strange paranoia around other people I don't know, almost like just anyone else might take out a pistol and hurt me in particular for no rhyme or reason, even though I know it's almost certainly not going to happen. I'm fascinated with the mechanical processes of firearms and the history of countries' processes for them but I do not want a firearm and I am not applying for the relevant licenses to have one, and I don't go around places with weapons either. \n\nIt feels like at some point I might do something wrong, not for a sadistic purpose or for greed but like getting into a bad traffic accident just because I momentarily might get into a car at a time I might meltdown or look at the moon over the horizon as a steady reminder of time and stability in the universe. I don't often cry, but every few months I do with all this bubbling in my head. My short term memory is terrible even though I have excellent memory for information about the world like how train pantographs work (the part that makes electric trains connect to overhead wires). I have a few memories from long ago as a kid that I try to bring up for comfort but then I feel often worse after and feel like a loser of some kind for depending on such things or how it is so different from what I am interested in now and how I must surely be capable of doing more in the world with the things I know. \n\nI even feel like I would be a horrific parent if I ever was a parent, having no idea how to raise a child or that I'd inflict on them the bad genetic lotteries I have and that I wouldn't give them the love and attention I know they would deserve and make so many thousands of mistakes because I don't know what to do for them, and I wonder who else must actually love me as a person with so few people who actually know me well, and how I feel like I do things for others to just not let them down. I wonder how my mother and brother can feel anything from their religious beliefs and why they literally feel communion with others and I can't with the emotion that should go into it, and their relationships with others. \n\nIt hurts so much and this is one of the few times I feel like crying while writing this. I don't have any suicial thoughts but I do think about death a lot, both my own and the concept of it. ",

My mom is an angry woman. Not necessarily a bad person just...angry. Never really went out of her way to say nice or supportive things to me growing up. I have two sisters that I barely know anything about.\n\nMy wife and I are in dire straits. We haven't been able to have a kid which has been devastating for us. We're in marriage counseling to unpack years of slipping off the rails. I have fucked up pretty badly but only now is she finally accepting that a marriage, good or bad, is shaped by two people. So we're working through things, and we really do love each other. There is still respect, there is still decorum. The \"D\" word is off the table as this currently stand.\n\nI'm here because I don't know where to turn for a male perspective. My closest guy friends are either dead, or in such bad places in their lives that reaching out to them is not possible. There are other men in my life but after my mental health deteriorated, they pretty much brushed me off. \n\nSo here I am. 38, marriage on the rocks, no kids, only man that ever blindly supported me is dead, one of the two men I grew up with is dead and the other is delusional and almost homeless. Then I find out one of my cats is not doing too well and there's possibly a cancerous mass. I'm at a point in my life where I'm scared of what will happen if I lose yet another person or animal that actually still loves me unconditionally.\n\nI think over these last few months of therapy and marriage counseling, I've realized that I've spent too much of my life not being nurtured and loved and I'm exhausted. So to the men I ask, is this the classic male struggle? To keep going, keep trying? Keep pushing despite not feeling truly appreciated for all your efforts? \n\nI'm so god damn tired.",

        "body": "I was listening to one of my friends vent today, and her teacher had had a conversation about coping with sadness and depression. I didn't want to talk to her while she was venting, and I had to run to class by the time she was done. Anyway, a few years ago, she came home to find that she no longer had a dad--he had committed suicide. And she has done remarkably well coping with it all. But the teacher had been talking about how important it is to help people going through those kinds of experiences, and I think it hit too close to home because no one saw it coming for her dad. And all too often we talk about the survivor stories and how much we can help. As someone who *is* a survivor of that situation - never that far, but I was seriously considering it at one point, better now - I couldn't insert myself, but I felt the way she felt because I know how stupid and dumb those mental health videos are and how much they pretend like it'll all be okay if you reach out or whatever BS they always say. But I also see their purpose to help people feel like they aren't alone or whatever, and I'm sure it helps some people. I just wish I knew how to help her. And I don't want to be intrusive, especially considering that we aren't super close friends or anything.\n\nWhen in these situations, I honestly just think of Job from the bible. His friends were the most comforting to him and helped him more than his wife... until they started preaching to him. I don't want to be that guy who isn't there because I'm solving your problem. Both me and this friend of mine are religious, and one of the main points she made was that the phrase \"Everything happens for a reason\" is a lie. And in a way, I kind of agree. I liked the way someone else put it: \"God makes the best out of any situation, and there is always a way He can make it better, but we still have agency.\" \n\nI dunno. Maybe at this point, it's too late. I'm just in the opposite position and I can't just be like: \"Hey, I'm so sorry about this whole situation. I feel a similar way because I survived and *your dad didn't*,\" that's just rude and inconsiderate. And any way that I say it, I'm worried that the message I send will be just as bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help is appreciated.",

My collage is a mess i have issues with my family, i have no friends and only thing i do is playing online games with my online friends. I tried to change all of this but happines is not a goal for me anymore. The problem isn't that i can't be happy, problem is i just don't care about being happy or sad. I feel so empty. I want to be normal and feel the happines or sadness. I had a girlfriend for 2 years and i think it was the best time in my life but when we broke up i changed a lot and i become a person that is always careless about anything and which has no feelings at all. After 5 years that i behaved like that i lost almost all my social skills. Right now when i go outside i just hate to talk to anyone. I just want to get the job done which made me go outside (Lessons, market etc.) and just go back to home. But my daily routine is kinda organised too. I eat healty, i take cold shovers, i workout at home, i sleep and wake up at the right times. I just want to change my social status and don't know how to.",

        "body": "Hi, my sister is in her mid 30s and since her youth she has mental health problems. She has problems to get along with other people, takes everything very personal and behaves in a way, I cannot understand. She often feels lonely and is struggling with life. I am really worried  that things will get worse but don't know how to help.\n\nFor example, once she visited my mom and my mom asked her if she wants to eat some cake. Suddenly, my sister became very rude and it ended with her crying. Later she explained my mum that she doesn't like that cake, however, she didn't want to make my mum sad by not eating it. Therefore, she started a fight with my mum out of nowhere so that my mum will finally say something rude and then my sister will feel better as she does not have to make my mum sad because of the cake and instead she can be angry at my mum.\n\nWhen I am around my sister, I am always a little stressed as I am afraid that she will be anry at me.\n\nMy sister is not a stupid person, she has studied and a good job.She knows that she has problems and reads a lot of psychology books. Years ago she went to therapy but that did not help has she sees herself as a victim. ",

        "body": "I have C-PTSD from living with an abusive, narcissist single mother (as an only child) for the first 17 years of my life, and have spent the following decade trying to reparent myself and unlearn her toxic influences. I deal with dissociation, memory blocking and repression but I have worked through and healed from a lot of what I do remember. I was seeing a therapist for 8.5 years, until recently there was an issue renewing my insurance and I haven’t been able to see him since November. \n\nI love cult documentaries, and the other day I watched “The Program” on Netflix which is about the ‘troubled teen industry’ and the abuse that takes place in these facilities. When I was 14-16, my mom repeatedly sent me to a Christian “boot camp” program for the ways I was acting out. I’ve always knew that was fucked up, and remembered details of the horrible experiences, but after watching this doc I’ve had very intense specific memories rushing back to me that I completely blocked out for the past ten years, and I am struggling to process on my own. It’s like I am re-living every moment of every day of that program. I realize how bad the brainwashing and abuse really was. Ultimately, this awareness will be good for me in the long run so I can work through it and heal but right now, without professional guidance, I am struggling with anxiety and intrusive memories and it’s effecting my day to day life. \n\nDoes anyone have coping mechanisms for working through trauma on their own? I feel like if I can dig deeper in some way to make sense of all this it would help me a lot. To clarify, I’m not asking for ways to cope with the anxiety, I’m asking for ways to actually dig into this and become more trauma informed so I can work through it. In a lot of ways, these new realizations are a huge relief and very validating. I just don’t want the trauma to remain stored in my body and fester if there’s some way I can process it and overcome the pain. Resources like books, websites, or any direct experiences on processing trauma would be so helpful. ",

I experienced a different kind of religious trauma when I was a kid (related to organized crime) and the Abrahamic traditions (and those that coexisted with them in Babylon, Egypt, etc) all have these practices of using deliberate, systemized trauma as a mind control mechanism “baked in”.  Finding an alternative spiritual practice like witchcraft, or even connecting with the lost spiritual practices of ancestors (who, ironically, were often demonized and forbidden by conquering empires that forced Christianity on them) can be quite liberating."

        "body": "Hey everyone! I’m new here and like most people my mental health isn’t great. I also want to say you are not alone regardless of how you feel. I personally am religious which helps me but I’ll never push you to have faith if that’s not what you believe. Here’s my advice though;\n\nLearn to love yourself. No one is perfect and that’s okay!! We all have qualities about ourselves that we may not like. I personally found this hard because so many years of being alienated by friends and family spending so much time alone with nothing but my thoughts almost destroyed me. I felt as if I was worthless and it made me crave wanting to be with someone to make me feel like I’m worth something. I realized a few years ago this was toxic. I’m still alone but I’m looking for people for the right reasons now. I learned how to love myself and it was terrible. I had to look at myself from every point of view possible and I didn’t like everything I saw. I went down bad because of this but one day I was driving to work after a storm and saw a rainbow in front of me. I still don’t know why but I just started smiling. Later on I realized it’s comparable to nature. After a heat wave or weeks without rain you may notice the grass turns brown and the leaves on trees don’t look quite the same. What happens when it finally rains? It allows nature to heal it won’t be quick it won’t be sudden but it starts. So sometimes you need to hit those lows to get to the highs. You need to be burnt by the sun to appreciate the rain. It’s all about perspective don’t just open your eyes open your mind and see the world a little bit different and I promise you there are better days. \n\nI don’t know any of you and you don’t know me but I believe life is precious and I know what it’s like to lose everything. I just wanna see the world a little bit happier and if this helps just one person I’ll be happy. I hope it reaches more of you and helps hundreds and thousands of people to be honest. Your story isn’t over. It’s just time to re-write the ending. \n\nMy inbox is always open I may not be able to respond right away but I will get back to you. \n\nI’m adding a poem I wrote I hope you enjoy! \n\nAnd stay Aspired 💜\n\n\nJourney-\n\nIn shadows deep, where thoughts entwine,\nLost within a labyrinth of the mind.\nA winding path, unclear and cold,\nYet within, a story to be told.\n\nThrough echoes of doubt, I roam,\nSeeking solace, finding my own home.\nIn the corridors of thoughts, I tread,\nLost, yet longing to be led.\n\nA journey inward, a quest profound,\nNavigating the maze, emotions unbound.\nThrough the mist of confusion, I strive,\nTo rediscover the light, to feel alive.\n\nStep by step, unraveling the maze,\nUntangling thoughts in a mindful daze.\nA mental odyssey, a personal flight,\nFinding my way back to the inner light.\n\n\n",

        "body": "I’m very confused about what I’m doing with myself and how I feel. One moment, I’ll be having fun and I’m happy but that’ll only be for a moment and then I’m just laying doing the same things over and over again. \nI’m a pretty young teen, so that would probably explain a lot of my emotions, but I feel like I’ve gained some kind of jealousy for this girl who I’d want to call my friend but I don’t know if I should or if I can because I don’t know if she sees me as a friend anymore. I used to talk to her a lot but there was some kind of falling out because she was kind of weird, but as time passes and that moment becomes irrelevant, I seem to be forming some regret because 1. It feels as if I lost a potential friend, and 2. I’m weird. Admittedly, I’m not as weird as she was/is, but I’m still weird and I can see myself in her and I feel like I would’ve been fine with her staying the way she was. Sometimes I wish I didn’t say anything because now I’m like… bored? I love the friends I have and I’m very grateful for them, but I really wish I could just talk to her because, honestly, I’ve been wishing, dreaming, manifesting, and conjuring up a person like her to come around and be friends with me. Even if she was weird and the things she talked about or was interested were taboo, I probably would’ve loved talking to her, and I did, but now I can’t because I don’t know how anymore. \nShe has changed, I always say she looks like every other girl now and hangs out with those girls now and I’m always criticizing her now, but in the back of my head, I’m weirdly jealous of her. It’s like a crush. And I don’t mean crush as in wanting to have romance with her, I just have some crush on her life. I’m always just staring for prolonged amounts of time just thinking, “Her life is so interesting, and intriguing, and is way more eventful and interesting compared to mine.” And sometimes I’ll even make up stupid stories of us being best friends and I truly don’t understand why, but maybe it’s a jealousy thing? Maybe I’m just bored? I shouldn’t want her life, she’s not a healthy person mentally. She has told me and my friends crazy things that no one, especially someone who’s young, should go through. But even then, it’s like I yearn for what’s happened to her to happen to me. And I know that’s not healthy, but I’m just so confused and conflicted and I am unable to understand my own understanding. There’s just so much happening in my brain and in this moment of time and I just think I don’t know how to respond anymore. There’s just so much I want to say and to talk about and to cry about but I don’t know if I should.\nI’m sure that what I’m saying is incoherent and probably does not make sense to other people, but I just don’t know what to do or what I’m doing anymore. I’m desperate for so many things right now and I feel like I’m going crazy.",

        "timestamp": "2024-03-09T04:41:03",
        "body": "Okay it’s 4am so prepare for horrific grammar and spelling.\n\nRecently I’ve had to decline a teacher training programme at my dream university specialising in my dream sector. I got accepted.. problem is I will be working full time for free (placement and 40-50hrs work per week not including assignments and work from home) and had to move. I couldn’t afford it on my own. Me and my parents discussed it but they was really stressed and it was a struggle to figure it out financially so I decided to decline it. \nHere’s the problem that was 2 weeks ago I’m still heartbroken and have no clue what I’m going to do with my future now as the only training (without specialist training) near me declined me last week. Last night my sister came over and my parents got a loan for her for over £5000 for her hobby, this isn’t the first time.\nWhen I was 16 and studying for my GCSEs my sister moved back home with her husband and baby, I was practically a mum to that kid. I lost friends due to having to babysit and my grades was impacted badly. \nWhen I started my bachelor degree I went hungry actually a corner shop would let me have food that would go out of date after paying rent especially right before payday I struggled a lot, I ended up moving home after my first year because rent was too high. I found out during this time they gave my sister £17000. \nAnother thing is the age gap is 16 years, she’s my only sibling. my mum (she’s 65) spends 1 week every month at my sisters to look after her kids, my parents gave her £30 000 for her wedding plus 5000 for the honeymoon. I had to realise deep down that by the time I move out settle down my mum may not even be around to spend time with my kids or even be at my wedding (I had to get ready for that when I was 15 when my mum had health issues) so I’m rushing around.\nI have a feeling the reason why my dad gives her so much money and takes money out on the house and get loans is to make up for the fact my sisters dad walked out on her and my sister uses that or waits until my dad has a drink to ask for money (she told me about that trick 4 years ago and I hate her for it).\nBut another thing is it’s my birthday and I can’t even celebrate with my friends and bf because train tickets are too expensive and I couldn’t afford to travel to the city and my parents chose to give my sister thousands. \nIn this family I’m just watching in even my nephews don’t call me auntie but calls all of her friends and her husbands siblings and friends auntie/uncle. \n\nMoney my parents have given my sister in the past year alone:\n20 000 for a house deposit \n10 000 for New Zealand (she wanted to moved after getting the house)\n3000 on furniture \nAnd 2000 for her new side business (she’s had 4 new side businesses the past year).\n\nMy sister has even asked me for money and I gave it to her stupidly enough now I’m struggling financially again. I can’t get out every time I find a way out something happens again and again. \nCherry on top every time she visits I just get ripped apart and belittled. I know there’s nothing I can do, but I’ve decided once my mum passes (which hopefully won’t be for years and years) I’m dropping contact with my sister. \nOhh and I have another thing we have a room filled with pictures of my mum being proud so her wedding day, my sisters wedding day, my sisters kids, my sisters graduation and even her husband’s graduation photo, I’m not in that room not even a picture of me as a kid, or prom, or when I got local government awards for stuff I use to do to support people locally (I have pictures of me with the major and my awards) but it’s still not good enough to be in that room I graduate my bachelors in 3 months and there’s no room in that room. I don’t exist.\nI know my parents love me and they try and not show it but it’s kinda obvious.",

I don't know how to explain it but it's like I'm choosing reading over the thought and it's making me feel guilty.  \nI obviously would not choose reading over the thought, but my mind is convincing me that at one point, I did choose reading over the thought and that because of that, I don't deserve to read. I feel sick to my stomach.  \nIt's just said because I was looking forward to finishing this book tomorrow but I feel guilty for even being happy about it because of my magical thinking thought and I hate it's like it's making me choose.  \nThis is literally making me so anxious I don't know what to do. I do want to keep reading, but I just feel awful & guilty if I do and I don't know what to do I hate this.  \nI feel like a terrible person for even considering the idea of reading this book and I hate the way I feel right now.",

        "body": "Short Version:  \nPrevious on being on SSRI/SSNI and Benzos made me according to my wife a \"zombie\".\n\nHas anyone notice any \"personality changes\" while taking buspirone?  \n\n\nStory Time:\n\nSo I am a 35/M - I was diagnosed with ADD when I was like 5. I had been on-off various meds for ADD until I finished college in 2015.  In 2015, my Stepfather passed shortly after graduation and really put me in a bad spot. Despite being recently married, I had started getting thoughts of Self-harm, and eventually sought treatment. My treatment plan varied medications which ultimately ended with Zoloft and Xanax. During this time  my wife said she thought I was kinda like a zombie and disinterested in things. Right before the Pandemic I was able to transition off the medication and was much more stabilized. \n\n  \nNov 2022 - My wife ends up in the hospital, sudden onset of heart failure at 31 years old. Ends up needing 2 heart stents. I spend the next 3-6 months while she recovers being her caretaker. Bathing, feeding, etc, all things she couldnt do her self.  Thankfully now she is in what is essentially a fully recovered state despite needing lifelong medication.  But last year the stress must have finally did a number on me, I have Hypertension now and on Carvedilol.  I went through a full cardiac workup after seeing what she went through and just the high blood pressure is all I have.   \n\n\nSo now I have been on the medication for awhile and been noticing some signs that seem either I am slipping back into a depressive state, or I have a new Anxiety or Stress that wont go away. So here is some of the things ive noticed:  \n\n\n* Fatigued\n* Poor sleep - Either unable to fall asleep or stay asleep\n* Weight Gain\n* We know about the high blood pressure\n* Palpatations\n* Thoughts of Future and sadness of it (i.e. Boy it sucks I wont be here in 100 years)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo that brings be back to my original question.  With the SSRI/SSNI being awful withdrawls and side-effects and the combinations making me more \"zombie\" like - would Buspirone be a good thing to try out seeing as I responded well to medication last time? Or is there a different path I should take?   \n\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk.",

        "body": "(for personal reasons I will not say my age.) for 5 years straight, I suffered from compulsive hand washing. At first it started off with me washing my hands 10 times a day. Now it’s probably 30 times a day. My skin is practically falling apart. When I first started washing my hands, I didn’t use soap. Because I thought if I just washed my hands with water the germs will go away. But ever since my dad told me if I wanted the germs to go away, I should use soap. so I did as he said. And now everytime we buy new soap it runs out in 3-4 days. Recently, this girl (let’s call her izzy) has been going around and telling people I don’t wash my hands. Because she saw me walk out the bathroom a few times before without washing my hands, reminder. I only use the bathroom at school to put on deodorant or to just calm down. And if there’s to many people in the bathroom for me to wash my hands, I just go to a different bathroom. (I’m anti-social lol) then when one of my best friends told me Izzy told him about this, I straight up laughed. since Ive been suffering from non-stop washing my hands for so long I found it funny someone thinks I don’t wash my hands on a daily basis. i have to apply lotion after every time I wash my hands since my hands are so dry from the non stop washing. My addiction started ever since I started to stay at my grandmas house. She use to be very abusive and she didn’t care about our personal needs, so i Use to go to bed every night with bed bugs crawling on me, dirt, gunk, and cigarettes everywhere. It affected me pretty badly, even though I hated staying over there, I had no choice. and me and my brother tried to make the best of it, we use to count the bed bugs, and laughed everytime one crawled on us. Eventually I gotten tired of it and I yelled at my mom for me to go to my dads house. And I just refused to go back. I am doing much better now, but it’s still a little hard to control myself. Moral of the story, don’t spread rumors about people when you don’t know the whole truth.",

She said if her attempt fails, she will try to get better, but that she’s too stubborn to not go through with her attempt. Apparently, she’s had attempts before. Her friend shared with me the date of her planned death. Despite being international, I have full intentions on calling the authorities. I have her IP, so I won’t have any trouble giving that to the police to help them locate her. So far I’m thinking of calling a few hours the day before, like 9pm the night before, but I’m not sure. I want to call when it will have the most effect. So, I was wondering, from anyone who has ever had a planned date to attempt, when would be the best for interference? Should I call now? The day of? Do I still call if she later says she won’t go through with it? I’m worried if I call too soon, she’ll still try on the date of/change the date and not tell anyone. I want to make sure the authorities treat this seriously and get her in therapy and medicine, so any advice on how to approach it is highly appreciated. And of course, in the meantime, I will continue to provide emotional support and encouragement. \n",

(I felt higher up than normal). So if I were to do the opposite of that I could make it feel like I was falling endlessly which would make me sad. \n\nI wanted to share more but didn’t want to make this too long.

        "body": "Today's post endeavors to enlighten you, our esteemed reader, about the critical importance of preserving personal identity and nurturing self-esteem to safeguard against the erosion of our self-perception. Additionally, we will explore the imperative of cultivating not only healthy interpersonal bonds but also a profound connection with ourselves and maintaining ongoing dialogue with our inner selves.\n\n\r\n\n――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――\r\n\n**The Predicament.**\r  \n\rTo some, discussions on these matters may appear taboo, trite, or superfluous. Yet, for me, they represent the gateway to self-improvement amidst life's myriad challenges. Hence, it is paramount to recognize the contemporary imperative of prioritizing individual self-esteem and fostering deeper connections within human collectives and communities.\r  \n\r  \nAs human beings, we often find ourselves ensnared by our own emotions, predominantly negative ones, rendering us emotionally unstable and susceptible to trivialities that ought not to perturb us. Consequently, we endure bouts of anger, swellings of pride and ego, unbidden bouts of sadness triggered by the most trivial incidents, and an insidious yearning to embody personas that diverge from our true selves. In this process, we deny our own identities, gradually relinquishing them, thereby stunting our personal growth and causing internal disarray. Regrettably, this phenomenon contributes to widespread depression, mental health issues, and the proliferation of dysfunctional interpersonal relationships that exacerbate our struggles needlessly.\r  \n\r  \nWhile I cannot pinpoint specific causes for these afflictions (after all, I am not a psychologist), I can offer guidance on self-assistance.\n\n――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――\n\n**Love yourself.**\n\nThe notion of \"giving to receive\" is a familiar one, suggesting that in order to attain something in life, we must first offer something of value in return. This principle pervades various aspects of life and is integral to individuals with commendable values. However, while this philosophy may appear benevolent, accurate, and intriguing (which it undoubtedly is), I hold the personal perspective that we must possess before we can bestow. Allow me to explain: we cannot impart something we lack, and this includes intangible elements such as affection and emotions.\r  \n\r  \nConsider this scenario: if we find ourselves in a state of depression, it would be illogical to endeavor to extend joy and affection to others when we ourselves are unable to manifest these sentiments. While we might utter kind words and undertake virtuous deeds, they would remain hollow gestures devoid of genuine significance emanating from within us. They would merely constitute outward actions, lacking the substance derived from our own emotional reservoirs.\n\n\rTo address this persistent issue, we must introduce a crucial and indispensable agent: self-love. This concept, advocated throughout history by various mentors and guides, may seem overly simplistic and ineffective. Yet, it holds the key to overcoming our challenges and becoming our own source of support.\r  \n\r  \nSelf-love is paramount as it fosters self-reliance, freeing us from dependence on external affection and validation. Therefore, it is imperative to cultivate a deep sense of affection and understanding towards ourselves. This practice enables profound self-awareness and liberates us from unjustly blaming ourselves for circumstances beyond our control and transitory experiences in life.\r  \n\r  \nWhile all present emotions and situations are transient, it is essential to maintain emotional and mental stability to confront them and progress despite adversities. But how can we achieve this? It begins with acknowledging our humanity and recognizing that there are aspects of life we cannot always manage or control. We must refrain from being overly harsh on ourselves and refrain from shouldering unwarranted blame and responsibilities. Undoubtedly, the feelings of guilt and remorse that arise from mistakes are challenging to bear. However, mistakes are inherent to human nature, and events will unfold irrespective of our desires, leaving us with limited control over them.\r  \n\r  \nDo you wish to transcend pride, sadness, or undue anger triggered by criticism? It starts with humility: understanding our weaknesses and strengths, discerning areas for improvement, and letting go of what no longer serves us. Affirm your desired qualities daily, stating confidently, \"I am strong,\" \"I am intelligent,\" \"I am compassionate,\" \"I am serene.\" Repeat these affirmations until they resonate deeply within you, and you will witness the universe reciprocating your beliefs with rewards.\n\n\r  \n――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――\n\n**I love you.**\n\nYou are a radiant individual, brimming with resilience and resolve to navigate through the adversities that pepper your journey along the winding path of life.\r  \n\r  \nPersist onwards, unwaveringly, in pursuit of your dreams and aspirations. Should you stumble, summon the strength to rise again and continue the fight. Such is the essence of life, and thus it must be embraced. I believe in your ability to overcome challenges, and I encourage you to nurture a deeper love and appreciation for yourself along the way.\r  \n\r  \nI extend my boundless affection to you.\n\nI am Love, and ***I love you.***\n\n\r",

        "body": "Not necessarily; sometimes situations are much more nuanced than that because the parents might have gone through their own fair share of hardships and personal trauma throughout their lives. I would suggest you look into reading and learning more about the topic of intergenerational trauma; it's something that really helps a lot of people with developing compassion and empathy towards their parents. All that being said, you have to look at everything on a case-by-case basis. In adulthood there comes a point where everyone has to take personal responsibility for their decisions and actions, whether they like it or not. A lot of people become more mature with time and are able to become more accountable for their actions, while for others they remain stuck in old patterns and find it more challenging to do so. In any type of relationship, the million dollar questions are: Are they willing to take responsibility and be accountable for their actions? Are they willing to make an effort to repair any ruptures in the relationship? Do they care about and take an interest in you as an individual person and in how their words and actions affect you?"

Certain things from the past might exacerbate my anxiety, but my anxiety is separate and it's own beast.\n\nEdit to add: Experiences outside of our homes can have major impacts as well. Like for me - I briefly held my dream job as an animal control officer. I had to switch positions because of how much my mental health was being impacted. I miss being an officer very much. I wish I could do it my whole life. But it's not in the cards for me and now I have to figure out how to deal with the trauma and disappointment."

It was my dad that often said stuff like that. It got me to the point pretty quickly where I assumed I was, and didn't try. I developed bad habits when it came to studying. I never thought I could do anything right, blah, blah, blah.\n\nI'm an adult. I need to own my behavior. Yeah, I have to understand why I feel that way, but I also have to push myself to do better and force myself to try. When I was younger, my grades were horrible, but I barely studied. Now, I work at my grades and I've got a 4.0.\n\nGestalt theory teaches us that everything is in the present. Yes, your past influences your present, but what matters is now. Trauma from the past isn't happening now, it's how I allow it to affect me. I can remember the past, but I can't control it. I can imagine the future, but it's no guarantee. I can control myself today. \n\nIf you're in therapy now and that's the message you're getting, you either need to tell the counselor that and see if they want to take a different approach, or you need a new counselor."

I’ve been married and together with my wife for a total of a decade but I’ve never been able to talk to her about anything personal involving myself. I’ve been able to talk to her about herself, our children, our families and anything else that’s not involving me. \n\nI’ve never had a connection with anyone in my life where I feel comfortable sharing and talking with them about myself and all of the struggles I have. I can’t talk to my wife, I can’t talk to my family, and I don’t have any friends I can talk to. I had accepted that I don’t have anyone to talk to and just internally compartmentalize everything. \n\nAfter going to therapy since last October, a few weeks ago I confided in my therapist that I have a big important connection with her. It’s absolutely nothing sexual or romantic. I just have a connection with her where I feel comfortable talking to her about anything and everything and actively look forward to it every week. It’s so bad where I told her I firmly believe that if it wasn’t for going to therapy and having her as a therapist I genuinely believe I would not be here. And it’s a struggle to be here every single day as is.\n\nShe told me she appreciates that but told me I need to have someone outside of her to confide in and talk to and rely on. The problem is I don’t have that no matter what I do. I have such a hard time trusting and confiding in anyone. Some of that is because of myself and some of that is because of what the people close to me have shown me and how they’ve treated me and my issues. \n\nBy the time I left my therapy appointment today I genuinely don’t know if I can do it anymore. If I can go on. I told her I didn’t know if I would be back next week both in the physical form or be able to attend therapy. I have so much anxiety and depression and this has made it all so much worse. I feel unwanted. I feel rejected. I feel pushed to the side. I feel like an absolute idiot. I feel worthless. \n\nI feel like I can’t do this anymore.. ",

My other best male friend has a therapist he goes to see every other month just for a general check in even though he doesn't need it as much as he used to. My regular customer at work goes to therapy weekly and has been for over 20 years. He hasn't had any major issues in at least 7 years but keeps his appointments because it's a good routine to have check ins and learn new coping mechanisms.\n\nIt might take a few tries to find a good therapist, so don't be afraid to dump one you don't think is working, but don't give up either. I've personally gone through over 12 therapists in the last decade. Two of them switched practices, one retired, one I moved away from, and the others I dumped because they weren't good fits. My most recent one, who is new to me, is already someone I look forward to seeing.\n\nYou got this! It gets better.\n\nAnd remember. You get what you put in. A therapist won't fix your problems, but they'll help you make a toolbox that you can use to manage your life and feelings and thoughts better\nYou got this!"

Go there if you're going to die before you can get in to be seen by another doctor so they can keep you alive.  They don't specialise in improving long-term mental heath, they are short-term specialists.  I'd suggest you see a psychiatrist, but also keep mindful of any physical health issues you might have, as they may be related to your emotional state but tend to be overlooked by the mental health system.\n\nIf you never got to the point of being honest in therapy, then go back, to the same or a different therapist.  If you want to feel masculine, you can pursue masculine-coded things that improve mental health, like working out.  You can go to your therapist and discuss how to be as manly as fucking possible and fucking terrify your peers with sheer force of testosterone and call your therapist coach.\n\nThing I can tell you is, nothing makes one feel less manly like circling the drain not knowing what to do.  What makes one feel manly is following the hero's journey.  It's being at the very bottom of life, after everything falls apart, and just barely grasping for life pulling yourself up and doing whatever it takes however long it takes.  Especially if it means swallowing your pride.  Then once you figure out how to save yourself from such despair, you will know how to lift up others with your strength, but you won't learn by staying still."

I have a boyfriend, it caused me trouble, it's been over 4 months, I didn't relapsed. Maybe because I wasn't able to talk to people (only virtually, never met them). There's this boy at the hospital who remembers me from highschool. How ? I didn't stand out. And he talked to me. I don't want my obsessions to kill me again. What should I do ? I need friends. I feel so bad and shitty. How can I even make friends if I don't have a personality ? I'm disgusting. I don't know what I am and what I look like. What I know is that I'm furious at my face. Everything is a mess, recently, I had a big urge. I want to use my box cutter again. I used it on myself because my boyfriend was ignoring me, one time. I only had to bleed a bit for him to notice me. I didn’t remember it cutting that bad, I nearly passed out since there was so much blood. I didn’t want it to bleed that much but I couldn't help myself. Now I want it to happen again. I didn’t touch the box cutter, I promised few years ago I'll stop hurting myself. I want to see my skin covered with wounds. Slamming my head Into the wall. I can't deal with this. What is wrong with me ? Whenever people look at me, I feel angry. I want to gouge their eyes out to stop looking at me. I fear being noticed. Everyone hates me ? I feel them talking about my face in my back. I don't know why I think they want me out of the hospital. I would feel so happy If I covered my face with bruises and wounds. It won't happen, I want to live a normal life, I don't want my family to worry about my skin. I can't be honest with the hospital. Something's wrong, I don't know. I tell them I'm anxious. And that I feel better. My mouth speaks lies. ",

My family is great and, even if i don’t have many friends, i’m really happy with the ones i have. From the outside my life is great and many people tell me that, but i can’t help but feel empty, almost as if i’m basically faking everything. I hide my real opinions from other people, even my friends, to avoid them disliking me, i keep on pushing myself even if i’d rather just stop everything and i force myself to do things i’m not comfortable with just to avoid the risk of being judged or left alone. In the past months i’ve started feeling i’ve been pretending to be someone else more than before, but the problem is that it’s taking a toll on me: in the past month i went from having never drunk alcohol in my life to getting completely wasted twice, i’ve occasionally smoked and developed other unhealthy coping mechanisms. I just want to have a break from the life i’m living and everyone’s expectations but i know there is no way this will happen, especially because i don’t want people to see who i really am, as i’m not as great as a person as they think i am. What is happening to me? Is there a way to fix it? I’m sorry if this post makes no sense but i had to get this off my chest and cannot bring myself to reveal to someone that the person they think they know is someone completely different.

        "body": "I don't see a reason to keep living, the only thing stopping me from ending it is mainly a mixture of pure fear of doing the act itself and the tiny rational thinking voice left in me that knows it it not what I should do. There are a few things I want to say before going into this 1. I will try my best to format this as well as I can go follow the requirements but there may be some messiness, but hopefully it is good enough for it to stay up. 2. I particularly struggle with being able to put my feelings into words, which is something that may explain some of the problems I am going to mention in this post. 3. I understand that to many people here my problems may seem stupid, but I am in a state where every view days I get close to if not fully having a panic attack because of this and these problems have caused me to question what is the point of keeping up my life, despite the fact I am trying to talk myself out of it't think I'm at huge risk. 4. This may be the most important disclaimer, but there has really been no events in my life to cause me to be this way, I have had a good upbringing and there is no traumatic events to explain why I am this way, this is all really in my head. 5. I have uploaded posts on here before, but I feel like this is the last time I will do this, I am at the point where I feel like I am going to completely shutdown myself and give up. \n\nI (16M), do not feel like I am a real person. I know I am real, or as real as any of us can be if we are going to go into the whole philosophical \"I think therefore I am\" discussion, however, I don't feel real. I feel like a fascade who has no opinions or connections. I don't think I am sociopath since I feel enough emotions at the end of it to not be emotionless, I have experienced joy and I have cried (despite struggling) when no one is around, however, I don't think I am a real human when it comes to my brain. \n\nOut of three main things I am going to mention I feel like personality is the smallest of these issues (the next two things are what are really causing my problems) but I don't know if I have a real personality. I take traits that I desire to have and try to act them out, this may be a sign of it being my personality in the first place, but at the same time it doesn't, it feels like I am not being my true self but not as much by choice, more from the fact I don't know who my truth self is. This is the smallest issue however because it is not fully possible for me to to fake either, since I feel personality that I have not chosen seems to slip out that I don't think it's a huge problem, I am myself in some regards mostly when it comes to how I behave. \n\nSecondly, this is one of the big two, maybe the one that has been bothering me the most but I am keeping the other for last because if I am try to think what would seem the most depressing in the scheme of things the other is way worse, but I don't feel like I have any opinions of my own, as in I steal them. This one will probably take the longest time to explain it. 1. I don't do this for anyone else, I do this because I steal the opinions I want to have, since I struggle to form my own or be able to articulate myself to myself I probably feel a need to do this. Maybe I do have real opinions, but can't even explain them to myself? 2. I don't just take the most popular opinions or make up fake ones to be a contreion for the sake of being a contraion (sorry for probably not spelling that correctly), this is the weirdest bit. I select someone, let's use movies as an example. I pick a critic, and I use that critics opinions from now on. I rate films the same as them, I will make the same points as them, etc. I may not even watch a film unless they've seen it. This is mainly the case with media (e.g. films, tv, video games, music, etc. which may not seem like a big deal, but media computation is my main hobby so this really is a big deal in my small life, it is one of the things I'm associated it with). This is a smaller problem (not to the same extent but sometimes still there) with food, drinks, places, maybe even politics (though with that one I kind of pick the ones that make the sense to me so I would not say that one is too bad, and the others it is sometimes still there but some of my expressions are probably true.) I try to think of why I do this, I am not trying to make myself look superior to other people for \"having better taste\" so it isn't narcissism, I am not trying to take credit for other people's work, I by no means want to discredit who I steal from. I wish these opinions were my true opinion. My best guesses are maybe they are similar to my opinions but due to me not being able to express them I need help by using someone else, and in the process taking it all of them, which I think is likely because I select a particular person for a reason I guess. Secondly, this leads into the other, and it's no excuse, but I think I have undiagnosed ADHD. It always feels like my brain is in multiple places at once and no matter how engaging I find something I struggle to focus on it, I have taken one red bull and two coffees today just to try to keep myself some form of focused. Due to not being able to be fully focused on stuff and be able to comprehend it all, this may lead into the struggle to understand my feelings on stuff and I feel the need to copy someone else. 3. It may be something else I don't know or I really do have no opinions, and due to that I need to copy other people's. This has been the thing that has caused me to have a whole crisis and be stressed for a few hours a day (I feel like this may be the time to mention that I have been diagnosed with anxiety and I have ASD level 1, these two are confirmed unlike my ADHD theory). \n\nFinally, it is about my connections with other humans. First off, like I mentioned I'm autistic so a part of that is probably due to the the inherit social disconnect I will feel because it. However, I feel like I need to rant about this at the same time. I think I'm Bisexual, I can only go into the emotional standpoint due to the NSFW rules on here (to try and be vague to not be out of limits I am at least attracted to girls and with boys I think I would be the same, with the main difference is that it would take slightly longer to get ready, but it seems to be still there). I think I have crushes, on both genders. This leads into the whole however I can't express myself so I don't know how much of it is true, but obviously it is harder to steal someone else's take on people so I haven't been doing that. I just don't ever know how I really feel about people, I have an idea, but deep down I don't know, same with friendships, etc. I don't know what I laugh at with other people is real laughter (though it doesn't seem to obviously fake to me or them so maybe it is), I also feel like no one wants to be around me (which after reading this you can understand why) and I just feel disconnected from the world. It is always \"I think\" instead of \"I know\", and this is the same with people. I don't know how to describe it, but this is the best I can. \n\nA few more things I want to mention. 1. I don't think I can \"just get thearphy\" and even if I get one since it involves talking to someone instead of just typing some stupid reddit post I don't think I will be able to be honest and tell the truth. 2. With the ADHD, I have mentioned it someone in authority but they seem to be in no rush to get me tested or on any other meds, which at this point seems like the only way to fix that problem because other stuff I tried doesn't seem to help, and due to being underage I can't just get it done myself. 3. With the other (apart from the potentially being the bi one, if I a reason to keep going I will probably come out one day) I feel I will never tell anyone in my life, I just feel like I can't, because it's all my fault \n\nI feel no reason to really keep going, I'm not going to end it most likely but I feel like I am at risk at shutting down completely and really have no purpose to do anything. I get good grades (though I struggle to study), there are some people that I think like me as a person but others it seems out of pity, and much more, but I am stuck in my own perspective with the knowledge of all this stuff about me with no way I can see to change it, and that chances me to fall into a deeper pit of self loathing. You can these things are not a big deal, but I am permanently stuck in my perspective so I stuck with this for my entire life. I struggle to sleep because everytime I try to at night I get a panic attack due to these thoughts, I have no one to turn to for these stuff due to it revealing  y true nature. When I do get to sleep it seems to be the closest I will ever get to being a peace. I can sometimes take naps but I am currently in a lifestyle that does not encourage it. I feel like I have no one to turn to and I am just begging for someone to even just try and give me some advice, because I don't know what I am going to do.  I want to find a reason to live, I just wish I could become a different person or be able to change all these problems with a switch, but I am unable to do that and I have no idea where to even start. I have no idea whenever to put this in vent or support, I think I'm going to put it in support just that tiny bit of hope despite it all. All I want to say is that if read all of this, thank you for reading.",

In the 21 century its hard to formulate an \"original\" thought. \"I think animals should have rights\" yea PETA thought of that before me. \"Murder is bad idk\" it's forbidden in every major religion for thousands of years. \"Man sometimes I don't feel real and just like a mirror of the information I take in\" this thought has been chewed through by many people and philosophers and you'll find more meaningful answers to that through a Google search or YouTube video then some reddit-smarta*s on here. We humans are just like that I suppose. And why shouldn't we be? I see something I agree on, yea why shouldn't be that my opinion from now on? If you have am issue with that there's a simple process: watch a video that agrees with a certain topic and then watch something that disagrees with it. Helps building your own opinion. No reason to kill yourself over something humans have been struggling with for so long that every answer you could think of already has been thought. It's kinda depressing ik but yea. Life is life. You should read the Bible and get into religion I think. That really helps with that certain problem. Finding meaning in yourself and everything around you. Another option is to flush your phone down the drain destroy your computer and go outside. If you see the beauty of life you realize how irrelevant everything else actually is. Can't help you with that bisexuality thing. 16 is just a weird point in life, you rethink stuff and right now your forming your character. You think about how you act and already that is forming your character by yourself. We all were 16 once. It goes away"

        "body": "18M, turn 19 in July and I haven't even had my first kiss yet.\n\nRecently I've been feeling some very unwanted jealousy towards my friends in relationships, situationships, FWB relationships, one night stands, etc.\n\nThey don't even boast. I just feel every mention of my friends leading sexual lives like some type of personal insult. I know for a fact they don't mean it that way, and I hate myself for feeling the way I do. These are some of the closest people I have, and I just get some type of gutteral reaction of jealousy and hate from them having sex as a part of their lives.\n\nIsolating myself is the only thing that's helped me avoid these feelings. It is, however, extremely unhealthy for my wellbeing over time.\n\nI don't know what to do. I'm so lost and honestly looking for any input on how to deal with this. ",

        "body": "Im gonna just copy and paste what i wrote to chatgpt, just to recieve the most automated and robotic response ever.  \n\n\nhi chatgpt, i need your help since i dont speak to anyone else about my problems and i never will and i just [cant.im](https://cant.im) currently obese, no friends, depressed and in a predicament about my future. i started sixth form studying history, maths and economics. I struggle with all 3, achieving a U in maths and economics. I dont revise at all. its so bad, i get pulled for these extra sessions and meetings, which are embarrasing. i am on the verge of totally giving up, even at sixth form i have 1 friend and hes very sociable and has many other friends. there has been a split in our friendship slightly because im soo anti social, it prevents him from fully socialising with others, so he has given up on trying to encourage me to become more sociable. so now i have basically no friends, i dont eat at lunch because i have nobody to sit with so i sit in class, just waiting for break to be over to continue with the lesson. I dont speak to anyone so it gets pretty shitty and I have begun skipping school and because they kept contacting my mother so much, i changed the contact number on the school system to mines, so i can just block calls and messages. Right Now, i want to leave sixth form since i have given up, only issue is it will most likely end all my ambitions and future plans i had. i wont go to uni and my mom will be extremely upset, since if i fail then people will mock her as a parent and look down upon her. I fear if she finds out i have left sixth form then i will get  asked to leave the house and that i will make her life even more difficult since my dad is abroad trying to start a business in agriculture so my mom and my 3 younger siblings are just at home me being the eldest and being a male so i feel like i have responsibility to help her. Im in a state right now where i want to give up on life but i dont want to abandon my 3 younger siblings (one being my autistic brother and my 2 younger sisters and my mom who's living like a single parent) i feel bad for my mom because my dad failed as a husband, father and man so i feel like she sees me becoming the same waste. My mom is a hard worker and works extremely hard. she raised me and my siblings pretty much her entire life on her own, whilst studying 10+ years to become a physician associate doctor, to then be a GP for 3 years in another city, having to travel back and fourth and work 10 hours. Now she had her own business for a clinic/salon for things like medical rejuvenation and is working so hard to try to succeed, leaving the house almost everyday. Most of the time i was too selfish and took it for granted how hard she works just to feed us, clothe us and take care of us, sometimes leaving the home to drop off all 3 of my siblings, all 3 going to 3 different places of education then she goes to work then she picks up my siblings, returns to work and will get home by like 8. Today, i was skipping school and called my mom making up a lie so she could send me some money, which i just use to buy takeaway fast food. What really made me realise was when she answered she responded in a very tired and exhausted voice, and even 14 hours after that call im genuinely still crying over it, because of how ignorant and selfish i have been whilst she works unexplainably hard, just for us and she is clearly fatigued and worn out by it. These things should make me more determined to make it to help my mom, secure a good earning and even retire her because she deserves it. I've always wanted to make content since young but i fail since maybe im not consistent or the algorithm keeps destroying my luck. Im thinking of just going college in September get my level 3 diploma within 12 months after, then joining the police. I like and respect the police but i have heard of how overworked, stressed, disrespected, understaffed, spat on and subjected to horrible sights the police are, making me respect them more but making me less encouraged since im from the west midlands and i know we have the second largest police force, which deals with some of people since i have grown up seeing that.",

I was on medication since 13 years old: antipsychotics, antidepressants, tranquilizers, everything imaginable.\nAnd it only gets worse every single day. No therapy, medication, life changes, literally nothing helps. I healed the anxiety and depression. But derealization gets worse and worse every day. I was sure I'm healing back then. But I'm not.\nI feel like this since I was 10. It never goes away. It never gets better. I'm loosing my life every since. I don't feel like myself. I don't feel real. The whole world isn't real, it doesn't matter, I'm just doing what I have to. I can't feel real, MINE emotions. I can't even feel affection or love. Happiness or misery. I'm so hollow. I don't even feel anything towards my family.\nMy younger brother was born, I felt nothing. I was finally able to talk to my father in person for the first time in my life... And I felt nothing. I feel something but it's just so detached.\nAnd it gets worse and worse. I'm loosing touch with reality. I don't understand what I am.\nI feel like I'm dead. I don't believe in real world anymore. I don't feel nor believe that anything is real. I think I died one day and never came back. There's some zombie like form remained, something so automatic that it does only things that had to be done. For job, for study, for pets, for family.\n\nYears ago it felt like I'm dreaming. Then like I'm in a nightmare. Now it feels like I'm dead. And I believe in it. I'm loosing the touch with reality, I'm aware of that and I still see and feel how I'm loosing my sanity while no one around can do anything to help, including myself.\nI'm detached on all levels and I don't believe that I'm able of having normal life anymore.\nI don't live. I just exist. Like something that isn't even self aware. Just exist mechanically.\n\nAfter so many years of this state with no progress whatsoever, with no even slightest feeling of reality or live in me, I'm now ready to accept the fact that no one can help. I died, the mind part at least. And what's dead can't live anymore. I will remain hollow inside for my whole existence.\nI don't know what to do anymore. I don't even know who or how to tell. Everyone believes that I'm doing good and better because I started going on walks, being more responsible, doing fitness, etc. while in reality I just don't feel like I'm doing this any longer. It doesn't bother me, I just don't exist here anymore. I just want to not feel physical pain and let my body be capable of basic things for survival so my quality of life won't drop even lower than it is.\n\nI'm so tired of loosing best years of my live to this stupid thing. I don't know if there's any hope for me left. 10+ years with no light whatsoever, with no even little moment when I felt alive, conscious, here. I don't even remember anything particular about myself or events of all those years.\nI just can't. I'm probably going straight into psychosis soon, I feel it and still can't prevent this.",

And after that read a Bible and realize that the emptiness is absence of God in your life. Fill the hollow with love for yourself, others and the world! And get off the meds.

        "body": "So what if you're a college dropout. You're living your life for yourself and not for others. If your parents really wanted a specific kind of daughter, then that is very unhealthy. You don't have to carry the blame for doing what you can with what you have. \n\nYou and I both have to handle our physical and mental health. That's a big part of life! You don't have to feel bad about making it a priority. I'm making it a priority for myself :) Sure I miss out on some career opportunities, but on the flip side I'm working towards a healthy life. If we push our bodies and minds through endless work without ever healing them, then we are setting ourselves up for failure. \n\nYou say you didn't fit in. If the people are emotionally mature and empathic, they will always accept you. Perhaps you were dealing with some insecure people. Or maybe the people you dealt with had too much going on in their lives to have time for deep friendships. I myself like deep friendships and I try to avoid surface-level stuff. It feels better. I can relate to struggling to make friends. I found I was seeking the wrong friends. I think it's good to accept oneself and our imperfections. We are all unique, even if some pretend they're not. Acceptance makes it easier to talk to others :) I figured out who I want to talk to and who not to talk to. It's nice :)\n\nYou're a good person. I think it's awesome you're making your own decisions and not following some rulebook that only makes you feel depressed. I'm sending you tons of hugs and love and I'm rooting for you <3"

Right now doing this addressing others issues where they're easily accessible is helping me feel better/get over it. What's teh reality though? I'm distracting myself from the fact i have no position no job no money and just ignoring it. What's the result of this action, feeling useful. Cause with the responses, and the gratitude as well as the sense of accomplishment when people extend thanks. I get to build confidence in myself knowing I may have aided another suffering individual. I don't want no one feeling this disappointment.\n\nSo for you i'm telling you straight. Accept it, make a decision, choose an avenue. Whether to dwell in or supercede the feeling. Then forward from there up or down. You don't want to dwell and have it consume you so I'm advising you to appreciate the feeling. Have yourself a cry if you must. Acknowledge that you cried. Laugh about that despair. I cried like a baby oh my gosh hahaha. Then in that joyous moment look up and devise a plan of action.\n\nIt sucks dwelling. It's hell on earth brought to you in part by: YOURSELF :D. Not fun.\n\nHope you come out on top. Climb up out of the disappointment. Take note of your accolades. Any small steps you take forward. Build yourself up. Be a stronger version a more honourable version of yourself. Then share that appreciation of self with the world. Be great."

To be the best person you can be you need to forgive yourself and have joy. You deserve it.  We all want you succeed at your pursuits and you have to let go of both your failures, although they shape you, they do not define you."

I also have always struggled to make friends and feel super weird compared to everyone else. I always feel guilty for the burden I put on my family and I feel like I drag them down. I try to help around the house and help with my little sister and dogs to make their life less stressful when they get home. I think a lot of people in this generation feel the same as you. You’re not alone and a lot of people are good at hiding these things. I hope the best for you."

        "body": "Nobody is unlikable. Nobody. \n\nI've met many people who are \"good at conversing\", hell I used to be one of them before realizing I was heavily abused. A lot of people like my former self are actually trying to hide their shame and their pain, because it's so difficult to confront them. I had the happy-go-lucky attitude and talked to so many people, but I was always hurting. I wanted to have hundreds of friends, a ton of cash, career fame, \"10/10\" partner, muscular physique (I'm a guy), you name it. It became clear that seeking these things was just filling up an emotional void, one that was getting increasingly bigger. After I started taking therapy and addressing my mental health, my perspective on life changed. I no longer value having a certain number of \"friends\", abundance of money, fame, physical appearances and bullshit beauty standards. I value a person that is genuine in how they feel; that they act according to what their body and mind are truly telling them. I see so many people now that are exactly what I used to be and I kinda feel bad for them because they're hurting. Maybe they'll get better, but it's on each one of us to change our perspective.\n\nOften times, we (people with low self-esteem) perceive our behavior as toxic even though it isn't. But let's say you were toxic. That's okay. It's okay to make mistakes. You and I are here to learn and grow. And you apologized! That means you were able to admit your mistake and try to solve it. That is a very very good quality that outshines anything a non-apologizing \"picture perfect\" person can muster.\n\nI think you're on a very good path in life. I understand your fears about hurting others. You can allow yourself to forgive yourself for what you didn't like about your past self and you can allow yourself to change your view on your future. It's okay to take small or even tiny steps. When I see you write about such an integral part of yourself, I see you're already making great progress. What you're doing is very brave and I think you're very strong for doing it. You're a really good person and you will find truly loving friends :)"

And from the look of it, they can't deal with it.\nOn the other hand i also find it liberating\nI can finally say that other than the professionals working with me, nobody really gives a shit about me anymore. I can wallow in my depression all alone how its meant to be.\nThe next few days will decide if my friends are my friends or until its convenient.\nOtherwise my soul goes out to all you broken people.\nIf all else fails at the end of this natural life there is the warm embrace of sweet oblivion.",

If youre worried about abuse from her knowing, i would suggest talking to your guidance counselor, or telling your gp that at your next regularly scheduled appointment if its not too far out.\n\nFor now though, try eating many small things. For me fruit is something i can always eat, even if im nauseous from not eating for days.\n\nYoure gonna be alright man, eating disorders are a bear but you can get through it. If you have any other questions, lmk.

I try to come to a conclusion that it will make me feel bad if I do something/come to a bad conclusion based off of what just happened, with anything.\n\nI recently tried mushrooms because I read about how it had genuinely helped some people and their mental problems. I didn’t go into it thinking it was some magic cure but I thought it would mellow me out a bit. It made it worse, in a way. I’ve gained this expectation of myself to stop overthinking, which only makes me worry more when I actually do it, in tandem with the overthinking itself.\n\nSometimes I feel like I’m genuinely not as sane as others. I’ve had low points where I’ve just been overloaded in my brain with negative thoughts and worries. It causes me to be rude to others and makes me procrastinate things that are actually important. It feels like I’m on a different wavelength to everyone around me, just in terms of how I experience my life. My friends are able to just let different thoughts go to the back of their head, it seems, and when I ask them about it they say something along the lines of “why are you even thinking about that?”\n\nIs there anyone who has dealt with severe overthinking in the past who can shed some light on what I’m doing wrong??",

If you are teaching me physical movements, I need you to stand next to me. If you stand in front of me, I can’t easily mirror your example. \n\nI struggle with any test problems that show me an unfolded box (so it’s in 2D but 3D would be an issue too) and then ask me to pick that same image from a different perspective. My mind seemingly can’t or won’t be able to do this without an exhaustive amount of work. It’s at least partly a deficit in spatial reasoning and perhaps spatial awareness. \n\nI’m not clumsy. I do okay with maps. If a mini map in a game rotates, it makes following it extremely difficult. If the mini map is fixed with north always being up, I do much better. I sometimes have to think about left and right. I do have Aphantasia which means I don’t have a minds eye and don’t have visual memories or the ability to visualize. I can conceptualize. Aphantasia isn’t considered a deficit nor do I worry about it. \n\nI sometimes boil it down to, I can’t play Monkey See, Monkey Do. I’ve learned to be an excellent volleyball player. I don’t ever run into my partner. I can follow the trajectory of the ball. Yet, if someone shows me how to do something new or different, I can’t copy them. Mirrored is way worse. \n\nLearning sign language would be extremely difficult. Watching someone demonstrate a word results in me doing things like using the wrong hand or if the gesture requires my hand to face away from my body, I’m very likely going to do it with my hand facing another way. It feels like what I would call spatial dyslexia or an inability to examine and interpret spacial information. If spacial dyslexia is an actual thing, I’m not using it as an actual name for my issue but a description of my issue. \n\nAny insights would be greatly appreciated. ",

I was raised by a single mom- I'll give context as to why this is important to note. \n\nMy dad walked out on my mum before I was born, cheated on my mum, his gf told him to stay away from both of us. My mum got a 'court order' for him to stay away from us till I was 18 (which probably doesn't exist cause that makes no sense). He's been in and out briefly for the past couple of years, never consistent, shows more love to his other kids and I got tired of trying to get him to love me basically. This as you can imagine screwed me up mentally and emotionally. I feel unlovable, have serious abandonedment issues and esteem issues. \n\nMy mother, has provided for me financially since birth. However she isn't the best parent emotionally. When she goes through hard days and all she lashes out at me and can say the meanest things. Anyway, she is dating like she always has and it's really messing with me. I'm so used to seeing men come in and out..nothing is permanent, and they say hurtful things about me and don't care for me. It might be triggering an abandonment wound or something. When I try to speak to her during the little time she has, she doesn't pay attention to what I'm saying (she'll be texting her new guy) and the other day when I got sick, instead of going with me to get meds she chose to go out with this dude which was extremely triggering. She just is not present. And it feels like she just doesn't care about me anymore and she's got more important things to do \n\nAnyway, my mental health is declining again and I'm feeling slightly suicidal...well I'm having ideations but I never actually give in to them. Like \"why was I even born\" \"It hurts so much to exist\" and I feel like my parents don't realise how they are hurting me or hurt me. I'm African so confronting my parents is never the right thing to do because it's disrespectful. This sucks so much\n",

I’ve had disordered eating for at least 4 years now yet my parents constantly police what food im eating and judge me for not exercising, yet happily reassure me that im not fat and my body is perfect (I have almost no muscle mass and am borderline overweight according to my BMI, i know it’s not a perfect measurement of body health but i feel it’s applicable here). \n\neven with daily vitamin d supplementation I am still deficient and at best still feel fatigued and lacking energy. I struggle to do even basic things like having a shower and usually have to spend multiple hours mentally preparing myself for them. I don’t enjoy any of the hobbies i used to and spend most days bouncing between the few things i have the energy to do to distract myself from how bad things are. whenever i have to go out in public i always feel on the verge of having a panic attack and usually do later in the day when it’s ‘safe’. whenever i am yelled at by parents or accused of something I didn’t do (which happens several times a day) I tense up and become very defensive and stressed. and whenever something happens that upsets me, no matter how trivial it is, there’s a chance I have a whirlwind of negative thoughts reminding me that I used to not be a failure at everything and not collapse over the slightest of things, and then I break down and try to harm myself as much as possible until it’s enough to distract from the anguish.\n\ndespite all of this my parents still expect me to be able to function like a normal person and regularly remind me how disappointed they are that I don’t, let alone that I can’t work or study or whatever else. despite having a gp that’s good with mental health issues and a psychologist that I see monthly and despite telling them all of this my only diagnosis is ‘depression’ and that’s all im receiving support for. I have no way of supporting myself financially or leaving home, and all of my relatives live on the other side of the world. every day is a struggle to convince myself things will improve but it just hurts, and I don’t know how much longer I can take it. \n\nwhat do I do.",

I got hit by a bad bout of insomnia after a breakup with a narcissist a month and a half ago and it got really bad to the point where I’ve been put on sleeping tablets. The breakup, as well as the insomnia was a lot for me to deal with and I believe it has traumatised me. \n\nAs a result of the lack of sleep, ruminating and the negative emotions surrounding the whole situation I began to feel quite emotionally numb. I can still smile, laugh, feel up, down, sad and angry but I just don’t feel these emotions as intensely or in the same way. Not like I used to. I think detached is the right word for it, just not myself. Not really as empathetic towards others as I usually am.\n\nIt’s been quite scary feeling this way and I feel constant anxiety around this too. I’m currently in talking therapy trying to unravel everything and I do believe it helps. Some days are definitely better than others. There are times where I am chill and upbeat so I do have hope.  \n\nPlease let me stress that I’m not suicidal, particularly down about life or struggling to get out of bed like I was before. I’ve actually gotten back to work and I’ve been able to get myself back to doing things. When this began I was confined to the corner of my bedroom for 2 weeks.\n\nIs this something that can and will get better over time? I am worried about my well-being, mental health and I just want to know that I’ll get better and get through this. My anxiety has been bad as well as my health anxiety too. \n\nMy general outlook of life prior to this difficult time was quite positive and goal driven. It’s now just day to day, and a bit meh. I’m still setting goals and achieving them, but nothing feels the same. I feel like I’m living in my head. ",

Whether it’s before a big presentation, a job interview, or a social event,\r  \n\r  \nI remember one time I had to give a speech in front of my whole class. I was so nervous, I couldn’t even say my name. And That’s how powerful nervousness can be.\r  \n\r  \nYou might already know some common ways to deal with nervousness, like taking deep breaths, chewing gum, or thinking positively.\r  \n\r  \nBut while finding a better solution on how I can overcome nervousness, I found a great research study on the neuroscience of Visualization.\r  \n\r  \nNow, you might be wondering, how can visualization help with nervousness?\r  \n\r  \nYou see, Visualization is the process of creating mental images or pictures in one’s mind.\r  \n\r  \nIt involves using sensory information and the imagination to simulate experiences and situations that feel real despite not being physically present.

        "body": "I'm here to vent without using a throwaway account because I want to bring to light of what people have done to me and intend to help people specifically on mental health issues once I can solve my own issues. Typing this from my home country using a VPN to access reddit.\nI am at a place where if I dont explicitly state in my mind \"kindness\", I will shatter into a million pieces. Btw, I can assure you that I feel at peace because of the \"kindness\" thing and I am recuperating, so no need to worry about me. Unfortunately, I cannot function without it anymore, because once I stop explicitly (or of its not loud enough), I will instantly start to shatter again. It's insanely bad. My therapist last year from my company's benefits (outsourced clinic, with a seemingly reputable background) damaged me greatly under the pretense of helping me, and even after cutting her off from last July I was still affected by her just because I wanted to help myself to process the possible things that made me struggle mentally. Even though she said something that helped me feel so much calmer when she said that I experienced fearful attachment, the rest of it was extremely harmful and I pretty much had to declare everything that she said as false (she pretty much poisoned the well that could have made me feel better). My therapist this year, which I braved enough to see after what happened, crossed a very sensitive line and kept on prying without consent. Even though the session only happened for 17 minutes last Tuesday (I purposely cut the session by hanging up because it was online), I had to take urgent leave and go back to my home country because I was already starting to be unproductive at work and it was insanely tough to keep my mind in one piece last weekend (I am very glad that my work department, boss, and family \nare very open to my struggles). My mind is at a almost shattered state and I have to pick up the pieces even though its negative 100% my fault and I already completely threw away what the therapist had said. I am sick and frustrated of my struggles that is absolutely not my fault and the online resources which just hurt me more when I tried to follow it last year. I will sue the therapist once I get better. I don't care. I literally cannot afford mentally and financially to experience something like this again. Also, literally screw churches who keep asking for money or make as if God is someone who has special access or someone who cannot be themselves. Screw people who claim to be good Christians for always making me feel that Im always on the wrong track in my faith and that I need to forgive someone, and making me feel that I can never get God right as a result. I can only count the times on a single hand on when I could actually feel my conscience and actually have a straight mind, and that was only starting late 2022 when I was so angry I didnt care what anyone said. So f-ed up to only ever feel actually healthy mentally at the age of 21. (Note : to those who believe in Christ, your spiritual being can very absolutely be  affected by your mental health issues, and it is always better in the end to prioritize yourself before God based on my experience.)\nI really wish I can get the help that I need, but I need to it be handed to me. I literally can't afford to make another mistake for the sake of my own life. I also really wish that mental health issues were visible. It really sucks that everything from being pulled apart mentally to being super weighted down or panicky when getting out of bed is super real but invisible to others. I know my mental health situation is like a chronic disease already, but its really much safer for me to self medicate (which has made me feel better) than search for professional help (which has made me feel worse).\nI'd also like to say that I have met a very understanding psychologist who was a master student in training who helped me a lot during university, but it sucks that I'm in this situation.\nDear everyone, mental health problems are negative 100% your fault and you deserve the help you need. Not your fault if your therapist hurts you, and I hope you guys will have the support you need. No one should have to suffer from mental health issues. Thanks for taking the time to read this, really appreciate it.",

I cannot afford therapy, so I am looking for self help books. a little about me that I’m looking to change: \n\n- very codependent on others. I feel that I need someone to go with me places even if it’s just to get gas at times. I guess that’s also a form of social anxiety?\n\n- meeting new people is hard. I am scared to put myself out there and talk to new people. and when I do meet someone, I fall fast. I lose all of the boundaries I have set for myself and allow people to walk all over me.\n\n- I overthink everything. my mind is always racing with negativity. I always assume the worst case scenario. and if something is bothering me, it will always keep coming back to haunt me and I can’t seem to move on and forget about it. \n\n- horrible fear of death. I am kept awake at night multiple times a week crying about it. it comes in waves. months on and off. \n\nI’d like to gain self love and self respect. I’d like to learn how to be happy alone and not need validation from others. I want to love myself and not allow people to control me. and I want to learn how to control negative thoughts that come into my mind and how to push them out or work through them. \n\nsorry if this post is messy, I’m not sure how to ask for help lol but if anyone has any advice or resources I would appreciate it so much! tia!",

Ty :)\n\nAnyways, lately I have been feeling like i can't turn on my brain properly?\n\nIts something i can't describe, but i feel like I'm constantly just mindlessly consuming everything around me. My mind is constantly wandering off elsewhere, but in a way that i cant tell where. When i realize \"Wow i walked like a kilometer on foot, and i was thinking about something, but what?\", then I would proceed to kind of forget/have a foggy memory of what i saw when i was walking. \n\nI remember the road since i go through there almost every day, but i Don't remember what i saw that day specifically.\n\nI'm not sure if i ever was thinking of something, it feels odd. \n\nOn another note, when I'm thinking of something/venting to myself, i for some reason always imagine it in a reddit post or somebody else talking it to somebody. Its like my brain constantly wanting to watch youtube/tiktok and be on the internet.\n\nI was just watching an anime that my friend recommended to me, and while it good, i barely remember the story. I watched like 6 episodes and remember barely anything that happened.\n\nI know the characters, but not their names or their storylines. I always had bad memory, but not this bad. \n\nI should also note that I have felt this feeling before, and i went through phases of feeling like this, and then being better, and then back at it. But now that i think about it, everytime it got worse? Each time i was getting even more and more mindless by the second. I would need to write a whole essay to describe it, but i'll leave it at that.\n\nAt this point im just lost and unsure what to do exactly, which is why i came here for help in a way. Im still considered a teenager, and i dont want to worry my parents just yet about it, since i dont think getting a psychologist is necessary yet.\n\nIm trying to get my life under control, but it isnt exactly working:\n\nMy sleep schedule has been messy my whole life, but i got it under some control this entire week.\n\nI journal like 2 times a week? I am working on doing it more though.\n\nSo, what do you guys recommend for me to do? Any \"diagnosis\" you can give me? Thanks in advance!",

But I was hoping to get some advice, lately it’s been terrible. Tbh I’ve been in a weird state since around October and all the changes in my life have made me feel all alone going to a new school, \n\nnot having any close friends and feeling distant from my family. It all kind of started when my brother got a girlfriend obviously I have no problem with it and I’m happy for him and she’s a nice person but she’s around here nearly everyday and it has definitely changed him though I don’t want to sound like a prick because I knew he had to mature sometime but maybe it’s just the autism in me that has a hard time dealing with the change as I don’t see him as much and he was one of my main sources of relief as he’s basically my best friend.\n My mental health is always up and down most days I’m fine but it’s rare that I have a great day and sometimes one thing can set me off and throw me into depression. Lately it’s gotten worse in the past month or so, I started getting suicidal thoughts and feeling extreme loneliness and lack of self-worth. Self esteem has always been an issue for me and my constant struggle to fit in with the crowd. I’m also pretty fat aswell so that doesn’t help.\n It kind of scares me because I know how and where I would kill myself.\n\n And I’ve been pondering for a while now if there will ever be a time in my 20s where things don’t get better no matter how hard I try and I’ll just end up doing it. Last month was the first time I cut myself don’t know why I did it ; I felt extreme pain and sadness and just wanted to let the pain out and sometimes I want to punish myself for things I’ve done in the past. \nI haven’t done it again as it scared me too much as I realised I’ve finally gotten to this point and it terrified me. I usually get better in the summer but it’s a daily struggle right now. And I keep thinking if I had a girlfriend all my problems would be solved but most likely it would bring about different problems. And I still struggle with my ocd too but I’m still hanging in there with the support of my family. I just don’t understand why it’s gotten so bad I’ve thought about suicide in a recreational way before but why has it gotten so bad this year when I’m turning 17.\n\nNot asking for any serious advice just wondering if anyone could give me any tips to get me through the days until I can get some professional help.\n",

Also I gotten made fun of for being dumb cause I couldn’t understand the schoolwork they was giving me \n\nAlso during this time I just gave up on learning due to listening to celebrities who said you don’t need school you can be rich without a degree. So that made me not even care for school at all.\n\nSo for that whole 7 years of schooling didn’t even count because I just gave up on my schooling which made me fail classes cause I didn’t study or try hard enough which made me way behind other classmates and students who attended the school I was in.\n\nPlus during that same 7 years time period my mother was busy working so I didn’t have time to talk to her about what’s going on with my life and my two sisters was busy living their own life and they didn’t have time to worry about me so that made my mental health so bad.\n\nSo then I start having this anxiety which was starting to get worse as each year went on which was never cured because my family is black American and Caribbean and it’s not common at that time to know anything about mental health.\n\nSo my family thought I was just lazy or a failure because I couldn’t do things like my other siblings. Which who can blame them even my friends thought I was slow because I didn’t get the class work fast enough like them \n\nFast forward to middle school my mental health had gotten way worse I start having these unrealistic itch on my scalp that won’t go away so I start pulling out my hair due to the pain I was feeling. My mom didn’t understand what was happening to me so she just thought somebody was doing witchcraft on me cause she grew up very religious my family are Christian so everything to them is witchcraft.\n\n\nSo High school came along and it was freshman year I wanted to be different to explore more and be a A+ student. But that change because I did oral sex with a guy on the staircase plus I lost my virginity to a guy I met through a classmate which I regret because he was a horrible person very selfish and my mom start calling me a hoe and slut shaming me and how my other siblings would never do such disgusting things that I did. \n\nI only done that because I just wanted to feel wanted so I thought having sex was going help distract me from going crazy but it only made it worse.\n\nIt’s a lot to my life which is too long to explain my whole life story \n\nBut I need anyone who read this to help me I don’t know how to be independent I’m now 21 and I just want to know how can I start to do everything my self like a normal 21 year old adult will do ?\n\n",

I graduated high school at 15, went to college for a bit, and ended up flunking out because I ended up partying too much, so I worked on and off between that, then my mom had a stroke and I took over her care I quit my job and dropped everything in life and became her caregiver 24/7 I was around 16? , also to add that both my biological and adoptive father are dead, and my biological mother as well.  I've been in school again for the last year and my grades are slipping again, I'm starting to drink heavily again, I received a DUI, which I’m currently dealing with in court, I’ve struggled with mental health issues all of my life with my first suicide attempt being at 9, I’ve been diagnosed with CPTSD, Autism, ADHD, and Bipolar disorder, which I think might contribute somewhat to my problems. I just constantly feel like a failure, like I'm not doing enough, and then I get into paralysis from trying to do things that it stops me from being able to do it, I haven’t been able to get a job and I've applied and applied tried different resumes, areas. It’s like I don’t know how to just exist anymore, I can’t relax, and I’ve dropped all the old hobbies I used to have, I should add I am just now getting out of a year of a depression episode that was more severe as my physical disabilities (EDS and Lupus) came into play as well and also because I was cut off my meds due to turning 18 but I got them back recently and I’m doing slightly better. But I still overall feel like a failure and don’t know how to exist or how to even socialize, I have no friends from high school because I dropped out and blocked them all. I just don’t know where to go from here or if this feeling will ever go away. I am currently on Wellbutrin and Vyvanse.",

I've been suicidal before and I know those places are a bandaid compared to the mindset she's in. \n\nI'm just scared because I know there's nothing I can do that I haven't already done. I'm supporting her the best I can, but it's to the point where I've been neglecting myself. At the end of the day, my mom wants to die, and there's absolutely nothing I can do to stop her if she makes that a solid decision. \n\nI love my mom, and I don't want her to leave. I've been crying the past week over this, and I can barely eat, drink, and all of my assignments aren't even a thought in my mind right now. I don't know what to do anymore about any of this. ",

A few years ago I started developing urges for murder and cannibalism, I couldn't stand to look at myself or my family without feeling worthless and disgusting. I had to steal alcohol from my parents just to shut my thoughts up but eventually my parents found out and the stress of that combined with everything else happening in my life led to me holding a knife against my throat. After that I would be on the brink of suicide almost every night.\n\nI started having very bad swings in mood and attitude, it felt like I was 2 different people. I would be angry one second then I would slice down my arm and begin laughing and admiring my cuts and scars.\n\nWhen I started work, one of my coworkers would harass me about being sad all the time and joking that I would go home, sit in the dark and cut myself. What he doesn't know is that it's true.\n\n20 minutes before writing this post I collapsed to my floor and began carving the scarred skin off my arms. I always tried seeking therapy or other help but my parents forbid me as they saw that nothing was wrong with me. I didn't want to tell them everything in my head or show them my cuts to avoid them finding out.\n\nOnly one other person knows what I'm going through to some extent and even then I'm scared to tell them everything.\n",

No honestly, I'm not even remotely lying. I've been so alone for the past few months, that people wouldn't notice if I went missing/ if i were to die. Sure, they'll notice it only after a week. I barely talk to one human or two in an entire week. And that too a 2 sentence conversation. I was the most extroverted kid during my childhood. Trauma killed me. Then I was modertely sociable girl in my school. Bullying crushed me. Then I was this, talk to me I'll talk back student in college. Heartbreak took my soul away. Now I'm all done. I'm so devoid of a soul that I wish someone/something would kill me to end this torture because I don't have the mental will to kms. Few days back I was scared to walk on the road because I noticed my body not flinching to speeding vehicles. I genuinely wished I was crushed by them. I don't wanna live for long, but I don't wanna die like this too sometimes. I feel like my life will change around by the end of this year, but it's a shit race till then. This is worst of all I'm facing and I'm not sure if I'll make it through till the end to see the good part. My painstakingly broken heart might probably kill me before I make it there. I'm scared and I have not a single soul to care for me. I'm scared that this loneliness might actually kill me because I'm noticing more and more health issues than before and they come back again whenever I feel low. I can see the body being physically affected by the grief. But I don't know how to put an end to it. Probably nobody would hear me talk about this irl. And I just wanted to get it out in a safe space without people pitying me or judging me. ",

I am now wanting to impulsively drink cuz I’ve been having urges too last couple days so I may have a can tonight and get more tomorrow morning.\n\nI worry I’m just gonna snap and lose control as I can’t even remember lots I did the last 6 days just snippets and when I am super elevated and happy I just almost don’t fully realize how heightened I am. I walked 30 minutes to this thrift store and that felt like nothing then left my cart in the aisle and walked to a coffee shop and I was thinking to drink and looked at the time and realized it was only 10am. But I just get so lost. \n\nI’ve never had anything this intense that I remember anyways. I did go through huge bouts of binge drinking last summer however. I just feel crazy sometimes or that I’m losing my mind. \n\nLike I love the highs but the debilitating anxiety makes me wanna die or do something impulsive cuz it’s so intense. \n\nIdek what’s really happening but yeah.

Also if anybody finds out they'll think I'm seeking attention. \n\nI have a very supportive boyfriend but i cannot burden him anymore I feel I'm hurting him too much but he's the only one I shared with.

She is now having auditory and visual hallucinations, saying she hears banging noises all around her and in her head, and that she sees figures of people etc. \n\nShe’s terrified of medication, but is finally on lamictal and hydroxyxine, which thankfully has helped her panic attacks and certain types of episodes. However, now she complains that her hallucinations are intensified and she talks for 8 hours a day about the things she’s hearing and seeing. She has a therapist and psychiatrist but I don’t know if it’s enough anymore. I don’t want to scar her but she needs to be on the right meds.. and her trying to live with hallucinations is going to do more psychological damage than being hospitalized. She won’t take them herself. I think the only way to do that may be in-patient care. What does everyone think? ",

I’ll feel on top of the world, master of my universe; and then like a switch, I just start thinking about all the problems in my life, all my mistakes, and everything I could’ve done differently. And then comes the lack of appetite, the unrelenting anxiety, the nausea/overall sick feeling. Sometimes it gets so intense that I literally have so little energy that I could get a full night’s rest and feel exhausted when I wake up. The real challenge is pulling myself out of depressive episodes, still don’t have that down. 😂"

If I didn't want to do my hobby for one or two days I don't mind. But more than three days, that's not common. Than I have to make another look at my behavior and feelings.

Each morning I wake up not knowing for how long I can set the backpack aside and stretch, only knowing it will definitely happen.\"\\*\n\nThere's this feeling of burnout surging through my nervous system whenever I feel tired. When I get to work and off work, naturally those times are horrible because of that. I panic about getting tired sometimes because I know I will only be able to focus on bad thoughts. Where does this come from? Is this a condition? There is nothing wrong in my life, nothing to worry about at all.\n\nI'm seriously worried, because whatever good or bad has happened - I overthink it to the point of dissapointment or resentment.\n\nIt's these mental mood swings at a young (m22) age that want me to end it all because, whether I can enjoy things or have a range of emotions (which is both the case) I end up with feeling like everythings a lie and the selfcreated distance to everyone leaves me drained.\n\nI'm young and looking for joy because I want to live a life I can look back on but whatever happens my mind wants to escape to unknown territory. I'm never in the moment and it hurts so badly.",

        "body": "I feel like I can relate to you in more ways than we both know right now.\nI’m a 28 y/o male who’s been living with his parents ever since forever. I’ve always been in their shadow, and I’m being constantly shot down whenever I try to make any plans/engage in anything that do not benefit their own interests. I now realize that I’ve been (and I still am) letting them push my boundaries further than they can ever go, or further than I would try and dare to push theirs. They see me as a punching bag who should be grateful for all the opportunities they provided me (I am obviously grateful for certain things but not when they come along with self-pity and guilt) I am also still financially bound to my parents and I’m not in a mentally healthy position to move out or tend to myself all alone in a little flat. I cannot feel like I have earned anything in life, especially in terms of money, I feel as if anything I own; anything in my room, or on my person, or my car or my PC, do not belong to me at all. I feel spiritually disconnected from all of them. \n\nBut here comes the however part. I do not know any better than to step out into the harshness of real life, so I cower behind these bars of a golden cage in which I am a protectionless baby to them. I know I have to get stronger or take some steps in order to get my life together or support myself by my own, but I just don’t, or can’t, feel like doing any of it. I have been very socially anxious as well even with people I’ve been friends with for decades, or people I’ve spent entire days or weeks being around. This had its toll on my body as well I think, because I’ve been starting to forget certain things about people or myself, even some of my skill set has been lacking. For instance I speak three languages and play guitar, have been for decades, but lately I feel like my abilities/my proficiency in my hobbies etc have diminished significantly. \n\nI feel so stuck with everything that I have, that it’s making me feel like I have nothing. No one to talk to, no one to love or share things with, nothing to keep myself busy with, nothing to have fun with or enjoy. Life has turned into a meaningless bundle of habits and acquaintances for me. I am scared I won’t be able to find meaning in my life again, or that I’ll completely lose hope and never be able to regain it. Having said all of this, I’m sorry if I have given you a headache, but I sincerely hope and pray that somehow you can get better and push through your own struggles, and I also hope your life never loses its meaning as mine has."

I was off meds when I graduated high school due to no insurance but also self medicated for many years from that point on. I came to the realization that with or without meds I needed something to help me function. How it helps is that I don't feel lousy,  angry or staying in bed all day. I am not on edge all the time my racing thoughts that kept me up at night no longer linger and I am able to better express my emotions.\n\n As far as cons go all I can say is they are not a cure but rather a band aide. It took a while for me to find the right doses and medication combination. As far as becoming addicted I had the same concerns and was reluctant to start meds or increase doses because I did not understand the difference between habit forming and non habit forming drugs. As far as side effects go I wouldn't worry too much about them unless you are not meeting with someone on a regular basis to monitor them. I found withdrawals from not taking meds properly worse than the side effects. Hopefully I got all your questions touched upon if not just ask here."

Empower yourself with knowledge. Seek therapy, a must. Exhaust every avenue that you can if you’re able.

But then my friends said i was talking to air.  \nAnd i this is how they described it:  \n\"It just looked like you were talking to someone without opening your mouth, you made facial expressions, moved your hands as if you were talking and nodded your head in different directions a few times, you also opened your mouth a few times like you wanted to say something but closed your mouth again, you were staring at the pc closet\"\n\nBut i have no memory of doing that?? I only remember how i just held my head in my arms and daydreamed. And then how i worked on the test. Could this be maladaptive daydreaming or something similar? Should i be worried? For i have no memory of \"talking to someone \".Like yes i did cuss under my breath a few times. But that is surly not enough to make someone think i was talking to air?? And google dosen't give me answers.",

        "body": "I am sure you have read the same news stories, studies, numbers, etc. that I have, all pointing to the same thing: there is an epidemic of loneliness, both in terms of friendship and romance. People are not making or maintaining friendships or romantic relationships, apparently prefering the virtual to real life interaction and connection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been thinking about this one a lot lately because it seems to pose a real cunundrum: despite the truism that one can only work on oneself, and leave others to work on their issues if they so choose, a crucial component of one's mental health--human relationships--will always depend on others. And in the most general sense, it will depend on the humankind's general will or desire to connect. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf that is being lost, then it is necessarily being lost for everybody: no matter how determined you are to connect with others, you still cannot control how much desire-to-connect exists on the part of those others you might potentially connect with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't consider myself particularly addicted to all the virtual stuff, and I am blessed to have more than a few IRL activities that I am involved with, and STILL I can't shake the sense of a nihilistic loneliness that in our time consumes everybody in a way that it didn't when I was younger. (On that note, I realize there is a subjectivity risk of romanticizing an older, better time, etc. But then I would merely refer back to the numbers: something has clearly changed, and for the worst, at least on a human level).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd finally my question: what is one to do given this tendency? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Part of me thinks there is only a religious answer to this question, but any thoughts are welcome.)",

Reading about others anxiety allowed me to identify with the emotion and work at overcoming it. I want to be able to express myself and rebuttal public opinion.\n\nI'm a coward. I don't particularly like life which more accurately is my perspective on life. Thus I don't want to wake up in the mornings. Save that energy for someone more appreciative. Not how life works.

They're just signals to listen to, and then to decide on whether to act upon.\n\n\n2) when you listen to the emotions, and understand their purpose, they often dissipate on their own. Comfort with them makes the difficult ones like grief less permanent. When you're also comfortable feeling joy, rather than afraid of it leaving again, it'll stick around longer (e.g. you spend longer looking at the ocean on your holiday, really enjoying the sight, rather than worrying about feeling shitty because joy isn't forever). \n\n\n3) no emotion is forever. No emotional experience is forever. Sometimes they can feel like that in the moment. When the BIG FEAR happens for real and you get the nuke of anxiety go off, that's hard to scrub away. But, knowing they're not forever and just sitting around and accepting the emotion you're feeling - not trying to cope, or self-sooth, to not-feel it you have a much better time. A short example is, anxiety techniques would build me to panic attacks, but opening up my body posture and accepting I'm anxious makes me feel better."

        "body": "I [25 F] have a pretty extreme and intense fear of sex, and have both mental/emotional and physical manifestations of this fear. Pretty much every sexual encounter I have experienced has been against my will and never felt pleasant in the slightest, and now even if I try to have sex consensually I hate the physical sensation of it. Penetration feels like I’m being stabbed, and any other contact to my “private areas” feels like sandpaper is being rubbed on me. It all makes me nauseous and I often cry, and I usually dissociate when people touch me. \n\nEvery time I’m around a man, even if I know he’s a good person, I worry at least a little bit (if not get completely anxious about) that he wants to SA me. I have a pretty big fear of men and part of my mind is convinced that they are all out to get me, even though I know that’s irrational \n\nI recently started therapy for trauma, but it kinda bugs me that I’ve never heard of anyone else having a similar issue, and makes me worry that there’s something much more wrong with me. (Maybe this is more common than I think and I just have personally haven’t heard of it, idk) This fear is something that greatly affects my daily life, and I often fall into bad periods of depressions where I mourn the fact that I won’t ever be able to get married and have a family because no man will ever want to be with me if I don’t have sex with him. \n\nIs there a specific word for this type of fear/physical reaction combination? I’ve heard of sexual aversion disorder, but “aversion” does not seem to be a strong enough word to describe how I feel. It’s not just that I avoid sex, it’s that I constantly fear it and it hurts physically. \n\nI’m not looking for a diagnosis, I know only medical professionals can diagnose, I’m just looking to see if there are any similar terms/conditions that I can ask my therapist about. \n\nThanks in advance!",

        "body": "Pain with intercourse is called dyspareunia. It has many causes, one of them is experiencing sexual trauma. Your mental state and feelings about it can definitely cause a physical response in your body. You're not alone in experiencing this! I have a degree in psychology and have studied this a bit (but I'm not qualified to diagnose you!), and I can assure you this has happened to many people. Not to make light of what you're experiencing, but even people who have not experienced sexual trauma can have some pain with penetration just from being uncomfortable or nervous.\n\nIt also sounds like you may have some symptoms of PTSD. For example, having fears of re-experiencing SA even when you believe the men you're around are good people, or just being fearful of men in general. \n\nI'm very sorry this has happened to you, it's a difficult and painful (physically and emotionally) thing to go through. You're on the right path by talking with a professional about this, and I hope you get the help you need. \n\nMany people have been able to recover from similar struggles, and this does not mean you'll never have a happy relationship or a family. Take care 💛"

I could tell you to focus on stuff you like to get a better feeling on stuff you do, to kinda get a bit of motivation back. Like drawing or making music, anything you like. Or maybe there was a hobby you had as a kid, but sadly gave up on it. Or maybe try something new? Like writing a novel or baking? \n\nI can recommend, cause i would guess you think a lot, do a little walk and listen to some music. I usually go alot on nightwalks that can go like over 5hours by just walking through the empty streets from the city i live in. Its calming down and helps me get my head empty. Sure my problems dont go away, but its defently a difference by thinking while walking than thinking in school/work. I got myself into reading again, now i read some novels while im at a park at night.\n\nDont look back on bad stuff that happend, like things you might feel miserable or your childhood or sm. Focus more on stuff you actually enjoy, try to make conversations. I know its hard. I cant even do that. And thats why i am here, to get my social status filled. I write more on reddit than i talk with people irl.\n\nIts normal to struggle with things. Thats how we grow and learn. Humans are not perfect. Imagine everyone is perfect and the same normal. Would be boring, dont you think? \n\nYour struggles, your feelings, your mind, your relationships, your body, your soul, your everything is that what makes you you. You are the one in control of your own.\n\nI personally dont like myself. I'm my biggest enemy everyday. Im alone, anxios and not loved. But im used to it, it kinda grew on me and thats what made me. Sadly i only want a person in my life to talk. Someone to be there for me and someone i can care for.\n\nI know, there are people, like me, out there that would be there for you, even when its just writing in a privat chat on reddit. Its even better when the other person is a stranger. My ears are all up for you."

They're gonna provide the questions you can not uproot on your own to properly digress through your affairs. So that's why you pay. If you can be curious about all of your impasses, and truly be their for yourself, you won't be as dependant.\n\nDistracting yourself is inhibiting you from facing your adversities.\n\nI'm distacted 24/7. All of you help me excuse myself from devoloping. I love you all. That's my problem. Then i further nessle into my zone. I get to stay isolated, and its all benefit to me. Due to the fact that i depend on others for a place to stay, and don't have to fear the cold, and starvation. Neglect responsibility. Stemming from demands Nd neglect in my youth. The people i wanted to work to support said they didn't require that of me. Now i'm a degenerate.\n\nYou can and most likely are better. If trying to figure it out helps take a deep dive in. I don't know if you need to get out and make new friends, but I definitely support the idea. Specially if you know you need a support. At least one person in your corner makes a world of a difference.\n\nRefrain from villifying yourself for being dependant just be aware of your actions. Set limits. You don't want to grief anyone that hasn't asked for it. Or offered you their full support.\n\nBeing friends is really foreign to me so I don't know what others require. Just knowing we're cool allows us to stay friends. Others demand favour. Friends don't use each other, they're there for one another. Yet I may have this wrong entirely.\n\nIt's great that you acknowledge that you have your own back. Some of us don't and don't know how to do that. So you're good for that. Appreciate that. Appreciation of self goes a long way so keep that up. Once you've secured your mind and cultivated more confidence you'll require less of others and can enjoy your formulate bonds.\n\nSorry if this is a lot. My mind does this. Which is why i self deprecate. I know nothing yet express a lot. I'm a contradiction. \n\nTake care."

For most of my life I have been obsessed with drums and music in general in one way or another. Listening, collecting, learning, ect. When I played in my first band it solidified in my mind that I don’t care in what capacity it is, I wanna be in the music business career wise. Here is the curveball: I can’t because of my choice. I’m married to a wonderful woman who deserves better than I’ve given her. We have been married 2 years but we have been together for a decade. For years and years I disgraced our marriage. I cheated, lied, hid stuff, made life more difficult for us as a result. In 2023, I was diagnosed started SA(sexaholics anonymous)recovery to try and deal with the obsession I’ve had with sex since I was probably 7 or 8. We both have been getting better emotionally but as a result there are some things that will never change. It could be the best opportunity out there, my wife would probably never let me be involved in my career choice with the attention it needs. All because of the choices I have made for years and years. Now I just play in bands and feel like no matter the attention we could get, I probably won’t be able to tour/be away from my wife because I was a filthy dog. As a result of all this, I wake up everyday feeling like each day just passes into the next with no importance to anything. Now before anyone criticizes, I’ve heard it all. I know “it’s my fault.” “I caused all this so I have to deal with the consequences.” “Maybe you should shouldn’t be married” “Your husband isn’t terrible for you.” To end this off, I’m sure nothing will change but I guess a delusional person can dream too.

I’m starting to cry multiple times a day and I’m constantly checking in on myself to make sure I’m okay even tho when I do that it makes me feel worse.

Sleep is super important and if there are problems with sleeping, this should def get checked out. \n\nTo your main question: I didn't really realise. I began to study at a university and I knew I had some social anxiety (didn't even know how bad it actually was, holy crap) that was in my way of studying. Because we had to hold presentations at some point of the studies and I knew I'd be way too anxious for that. So I started therapy for my social anxiety so I could study. I've been in therapy since summer 2020 now and am still going (and probably will be for at least one more year).

        "body": "M64. Thinking back, I wonder why the thought of therapy never entered my mind. I had an evil older brother, who emotionally I abused me as kids. Due to that, I was having night terrors in my 20's, long after I had moved away. I had medical trauma in my 30's where they had to hold me down for a very painful procedure, while I screamed. In my early 40's, I had an accident which gave me what I now know was PTSD. In my late 50's, I had a major surgery with a bunch of  complications and months of pain, that brought back the PTSD (I still didn't know what that was though).\n\nStill, at that point, therapy wasn't on my mind. But then, the brother got murdered. A bit of a shock, but I was OK. A week later, it was reported that he had been abusing his assailant. On top of that, the autopsy showed that he had been killed in the manner that I had fantasized about killing him in my night terrors. That really hit home, and brought back my childhood memories. I started having flashbacks, similar to the old night terrors, but when wide awake, during the day. I also started getting PTSD flashbacks about the accident in 2001. I was a total mess, with random crying fits.\n\nThe few months I spent on a wait list was pretty tough. Luckily, I got in with a therapist that was perfect for me. Totally client centered, narrative method, and she didn't say much. I went in deep right from the start. I just told my stories. She taught me grounding skills, how to recognize various emotions and how to grade them in intensity. I got so I could go right to \"the edge\" and recover, with her help.\n\nMy acute problems (mainly the flashbacks and crying fits) abated rapidly (months). We branched out into other parts of my life and how they still affect me: the medical trauma, relationship stuff, father image, neglectful mother, a few years of being totally unsafe in a terrible school with drugs and constant violence. Therapy was pretty wild for about a year and a half. \n\nIt's been 26 months now, and I'm still getting benefits, mostly on the relationship side of things. My therapist has shifted a bit more towards \"life coach\" type of things, and I am still becoming a \"better person\" in many ways. \n\nThe trial for my brother's assailant has yet to happen. That fact gives me some anxiety. After that is done, I'll consider moving towards every other week, with the long term plan of quitting altogether."

I was depressed as a teenager and young adult and troubled as a boy. It's a pretty easy line to draw from suicidal ideation to \"something is wrong.\"\n\n\nMy \"I need therapy\" moment was in the weeks after a huge fallout with someone very close to me. The short of the event is because of deeply intense emotions surrounds a situation that hammered on multiple deep insecurities, I imploded a personal relationship. It wasn't the first time that flavour of situation had arisen, so in reflection after the fact I realised nothing I was doing was really working out for me. If my favourite thing in my life is my personal relationships, especially this person at the time, I needed to get better to keep the people I have and to have any possibility of having that person back in my life.\n\n\nOne cool thing about noticing repeating patterns is that you get to test your new self against them when the problem comes back. And it will. For me I found all the smaller tests of little things resurfacing easy. The big ones though, those emotional implosion moments, very very difficult. I had a few more goes of it, and I messed up again each time. However, for different reasons, and with new lessons from each test. As a small sample, when I first started looking for therapy I wanted to just stop feeling the big emotions altogether, I thought that was the only way to be safe and have control. This is over 2 years ago now. Recently, after a few stops along the thought train, I realised the best way is for me to just communicate that I'm feeling huge emotions (triggered especially because of things like fears of abandonment, losing people, \"evidence of\" low worth), and to ask for time to re-engage with the conversation in person when I'm less extreme. Not had the test for this yet, but it'll happen."

I do have bad anxiety that leads to some compulsions, it’s not ocd but its some tendencies of it when i get very anxious, unfortunately I can’t be on antidepressants because they cause manic episodes so ive tried other medications and such, pregabalin works a lot, but i try to not be dependent on it and use it only for panic attacks when I need to calm down asap. My anxiety has improved a lot, when I graduated from college and was able to take care of myself more it went from being severe to being manageable.

Little by little big up yourself. \"I did it/ I did that\" appreciation of self is the cure to anxiety. \"If no one else knows my capability, I know what I'm capable of.\" Love yourself. You're young you're on time with your path. Appreciate yourself."

        "body": "There are simple methods for improving motivation in daily life, getting people out of bed and all that. They can even help people who are badly depressed, along with standard depression treatment.\n\nAbout depression, it wouldn't surprise me if this is your problem.\n\nWhen we're depressed, motivation for our chores and self-care can be very helpful. It gives us confidence. Activity, especially physical activity, is a kind of therapy. That's not all there is to getting over depression, but it can be very important.\n\nI know that getting professional help can be hard. I'll say more about that.\n\nPractical advice for motivation - VERY important -\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj70w9ZbZng&t=568s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj70w9ZbZng&t=568s)\n\nTreatment often begins by seeing the family doctor, who can give you a referral. I mention referral because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you'd want to tell the doctor include how you feel at different times of day, any symptoms you might have such as change in appetite or sleep, and things in your life affecting how you feel.\n\nThe lockdown has changed the therapy situation. You may want to look at online therapy and self-help. Healthline, a site I rely on for good information, has an article that rates online services.\n\nSome places have free therapy. A doctor or social worker may be able to help you with a search for therapy.\n\nIf you're depressed, I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.\n\nPeople in various countries say that they can often find the books I mention in my comments with Amazon, Kindle, or Google Books.\n\nIf you go to Metapsychology, you can read a psychologist's review of Dr Steve Ilardi's book (\"a splendid book\"). He's the therapist and researcher who headed the Univ of Kansas lifestyle-depression project.\n\nRelaxation eases the symptoms of depression.\n\nThe easiest way to calm down is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min in the early morning and at bedtime is a therapy. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently through the nose, 6 seconds each.\n\nA good habit - respond to moments of stress by breathing slowly.\n\nThis is one of the articles online with advice for therapeutic comfort -\n\n[https://psychcentral.com/blog/13-healthy-ways-to-comfort-yourself#2](https://psychcentral.com/blog/13-healthy-ways-to-comfort-yourself#2)"

I don't know if I'm just frustrated with the events that happen and can't process them or if I'm just too emotionally unregulated that I'll get that way at a drop of a hat.

What I mean is, people often make the mistake of doing the same thing over and over when they're upset instead of stopping to calm down.  Working while we're angry is just like working while we're drunk. One mistake leads to more mistakes.\n\nThe thing to do when things go wrong is stop and get your head together before you go back to work.\n\nThis is what borderline personality disorder patients are told to do - breathe slowly and gently while counting seconds - 5 sec. to inhale, 7 sec. to exhale. Do that till you feel OK.\n\nThe evidence for therapeutic breathing is amazing. It's used to treat panic disorder and PTSD. \n\nWhatever changes your mood - a funny movie or smoothing music - is good. \n\nWe all get angry sometimes. So long as anger is not connected to a plan to do someone harm and we don't hold on to it, anger is just an unpleasant feeling that comes and goes, like a thunderstorm."

I can start cleaning at 5 am and still be going strong without the ability to stop until 9 or 10 pm. \n\nEverywhere I look there's always more dirt, another thing to clean, an area to move around to get through more or things to be moved around and when I stop, I can't sit still and my brain is just searching for more to do even if part of me knows that there is nothing else to do. \n\nI was wondering if anyone had any advice on ways to minimize or mitigate manic episodes to help alleviate some of the burn out or spread out the episode so it's less impactful, if that makes sense.

When I'm around other people I spend most of the time in my head. I'm tired all the time, regardless of how much I sleep. It started being really hard for me to take a shower or get ready in the morning. I don't enjoy anything at this point. I stopped enjoying going out with my friends and we started to fight a lot, because I don't seem to care about anything. I know they stopped enjoying my presence too. They said I'm bringing them down with my \"negative energy\".\n\nI don't know how to get a grip on my life. It's hard for me to even try to enjoy anything. I honestly don't think anything happened to me that could cause this. What could have led to this? What should I do? Seeing a therapist is out of the question since my mother doesn't let me.",

I am actually here to help people, write with strangers and it actually kinda helps myself to calm myself down. I actually see reddit as a comfort zone now for last months. Ive been very active, not only in the mental health sub. But back to you.\n\nI guess its a normal feeling in youre current sitiation and the place you are. You dont have to feel alone there, there are MANY Others that feel like that. I could tell you to focus on stuff you like to get a better feeling on stuff you do, to kinda get a bit of motivation back. Like drawing or making music, anything you like. Or maybe there was a hobby you had as a kid, but sadly gave up on it. Or maybe try something new? Like writing a novel or baking? \n\nI can recommend, cause i would guess you think a lot, do a little walk and listen to some music. I usually go alot on nightwalks that can go like over 5hours by just walking through the empty streets from the city i live in. Its calming down and helps me get my head empty. Sure my problems dont go away, but its defently a difference by thinking while walking than thinking in school/work. I got myself into reading again, now i read some novels while im at a park at night.\n\nDont look back on bad stuff that happend, like things you might feel miserable or your childhood or sm. Focus more on stuff you actually enjoy, try to make conversations. I know its hard. I cant even do that. And thats why i am here, to get my social status filled. I write more on reddit than i talk with people irl.\n\nI know, there are people, like me, out there that would be there for you, even when its just writing in a privat chat on reddit. Its even better when the other person is a stranger. My ears are all up for you."

She thinks I don't love her or care about her, but I would actually die for her. And it seems like such a small thing, I'm making such a big deal out of this problem when people have actual problems not just relationship dramas, but I'm hypersensitive and impulsive. She refuses to communicate with me and neither do I, because I feel that my apology has lost its meaning, since I have apologized so many times in the last few weeks. I've made mistakes so many times and promised so many times that I'll be better, but I haven't been. I think she doesn't trust me anymore. And I can't lose her. I'd rather lose my life. I'm in no condition to turn on my problem solving skills. But I took quite a few sedatives and now I don't want to cut my veins so badly. But the fact that people can't stand me is reason enough to say that I'm a terrible person. And if I lose her, I lose everything. I lose my happiness. I don’t want to be perfect, I just want to be a good friend, a friend who you can rely on. But if I lose my personality trait of being trustworthy and caring, I lose my only good quality.

        "body": "I've come to the realization that I'm just like my father. I'm living with my boyfriend who basically saved me from my family, who treated me horribly throughout my whole life.\n\nFor a little backstory, I was removed from school when I was 8 and moved to a more remote area, where I spent 12 years. I didn't leave that house for months at a time, I wasn't homeschooled, I was forced to lie to people around me about what was going on in my everyday life, I was sexually, physically, and emotionally abused, and ended up spending 5+ hours a day cooking and cleaning for my parents, including moving their furniture to clean under it by myself. I was horribly neglected and terrorized by my father frequently.\n\nI had to get a forged high school diploma to get an ID so I could start working and get away from them. My boyfriend was my coworker who I fell for. Eventually he offered to have me move in with him to get away from them.\n\nIt's been a few months, and I'm slowly realizing how badly altered I am from my childhood. I have a horrible temper, and when I get angry, I shut down and generally end up acting like he doesn't exist. I have severe anxiety and get overwhelmed very easily, especially when I feel like the house is dirty. I get so stressed and start freaking out, feeling like I'm not good enough if I don't have the house clean or dinner cooked.\n\nHe tries so hard to make me understand that I don't have to get so anxious about these things. He doesn't care if the house is dirty. He doesn't care to have frozen pizza for dinner. He just wants me happy and I don't know how to be.\n\nI make him unhappy. He'll never tell me that, but I'm far too gone for any sane person to love for long. Therapy is so expensive, I feel hopeless, I don't know how to undo what they did to me.",

One of the most interesting things I know about this is a New York Times article \"What's All This About Journaling?\" The author of the Times article says that she has been very happy using the approach to journaling recommended by self-help author Julia Cameron, which is writing three longhand, stream of consciousness pages right after waking up. Stream of consciousness - just writing whatever pops into your head at the moment. The Times author said that this is therapeutic and helps her with solving problems.\n\nPsychologist Emma Seppala of the Yale School of Management says that we are most creative when we're relaxed. Creative people have \"idea zones\" -things they rely on for coming up with ideas like lying on the couch or taking a shower. \n\nA famous scientist named Helmholtz said that he never found solutions to problems at his work table. He would study a question carefully, then put it aside. The solution would come later, often while he was going for a walk.\n\nStaring at the screen doesn't give you ideas."

I have learned recently that many therapists are not trained to recognize domestic abuse and even if they are, they may not be comfortable to assist abused spouse. People always ask why people stay in these relationships, but the people you expect could address it are scared to also.\n\nI went with stbxh to several military (easy to figure out) counseling centers over  a 10 year span explaining his treatment: dismissive, won’t listen, tells me how I feel or event “really” happened (gaslighting), physically postured me aggressively, choked me once, degrading name-calling, saying i did not contribute to family, very loving at times, called young kids into our fights (many times)when I said was done and leaving, blamed our son (then 6) for our fights, he broke many things while trying to use his service as excuse. Only one therapist last year said his name degradation was “abusive”.  All the others said something like kids were manipulative to parents, astonished that I could get mad at him, or further enabled his belief that he did not have much responsibility as it might be caused by service.  He abused at least 3 other women prior to being in the military I found out.\n\nOf course there were actually many fun times and I would l get bombarded with how I can help my vet (I am a vet also)- this only added to dilute the abuse. I just wish I could have known much sooner.\n\nFor those who addressed it maybe you could let others know how you handled it please.\n\nMy kids and myself are trying to heal, but I don’t think a scab has formed yet.\n\nSorry, not trying to blame, but I think there is too much hesitancy because there are many forms of abuse.

If you wish to continue this friendship, I'd like if you could do [whatever you'd prefer] instead'.\n\nIf you haven't been straightforward about boundaries, some people won't pick up on that, and that's not their fault. I'd at least suggest tilling the friend that you're uncomfortable by their actions and give them another chance to see if they actually change and start respecting your boundaries. If you've already told him, and he still doesn't change, then something like the following should suffice. \n\n'Hey [name] I've told you in the past that I don't like [action he's doing] and you still continue to do it. I don't feel as if you're respecting my boundaries, and because of it I don't wish to continue this friendship'."

I've dealt with dysphoric thoughts for too long now and they've gotten to a point in which I'm really struggling to deal with them. It's a horrible thing to say, but I feel like I've let everyone down by having these dysphoric thoughts and I know people wouldn't want me to give into them. I couldn't put my parents through something like this. I need to be my Mother and Father's son, I need to be a big brother, I need to be everyone's funny guy. The thought of betraying this image upsets me. I don't wanna be a let down. I hate having to experience this stuff and I wake up everyday being revolted at not only my body but the sheer fact that I'm upset with my body. The constant discomfort and upset wears you down FAST and I just can't deal with it anymore. It's too hard. I can't live life constantly dissociated. I need someone to really help me build up the courage to talk to someone. I grew up in a way where, if you had a problem, then you'd just ignore it, get on with your life and stop being lazy. Attitudes may change over time but that was already hard-wired in. Also didn't help that I had bullshit friends growing up that either judged me, took advantage of me or projected their own insecurites and traumas onto me without second thought which made me feel unable to talk. I can't push past all this but I'm suffering at the hands of my own brain. I just need help. I wish I didn't have to deal with this stuff but I do. Repressing it doesn't work.",

        "body": "I hear you. Being trans and feeling like you still need to fit a certain model that you don't even identify with anymore is hard. There is absolutely no easy way through this, whether you decide to accept who you are and possibly displease those around you, or you people please and stay who you are not to be who you have always been. Both choices will be hard. Both of them have their pros and their cons. Only you can decide what path you take. And if that means breaking out of the idea you have to be a big brother or your parents son, etc. \n I'm coming up on my 6th year on T (roughly the same time I came out publicly, since I knew I couldn't hide the effects of T and I had to bite the bullet and tell people). So I do understand. Intimately. But I want to know, what do you want? If you were to flip a coin head you transition, tails you remain a familiar pillar for your family/friends.... Well, you already know what side you want it to land on before it ever hits the ground, don't you?  \n I think it may be more beneficial to look into these idea of why letting go of your former self seems hard. I understand how it is hard socially. But it can also be hard for ourselves. We can say it's only about the people around us, but at the end of the day this character we have poured *years* into... Are we supposed to just throw that away? Even if we don't want to be that person, even if it was an over-compensation for who we know we really are... I mean that is literal years of our life we have been this character. It can be hard to just be ourselves to ourselves. And then we may feel a layer of what if I cannot \"convince\" them that I am trans enough because I feel too attached to this version of me and I cannot just drop it to be this heightened gendered concept.  \nTo top all that off with growing up feeling like you have to perform perfectly for the world and hide your problems and emotions, that's hard. That's so, so hard. But I do promise, you will unfortunately have plenty of opportunities to hide your pain even after transitioning. Because it's going to be hard, particularly at first. Because people will question you. They will ask you over and over \"but why?\" And tell you that you are not. And it's going to take a lot of effort to defend yourself. You don't have to be good at defending yourself, because it's not your place to make them understand. But you have to be good enough to defend yourself for yourself. Because if you let them, they can question you right back into the closet. So you have to know that it's time for you to be free. And it sounds like if you aren't already there, you almost are.  \n\"Growth is painful. Change is painful. But nothing is as painful as staying somewhere you don't belong.\" Mandy Hale"

I understand the generational habit of sweeping our pain and suffering under the rug. That's just what they did, and those beliefs get passed down. For me, it was about abuse. No one talked about it. But then I got PTSD at 32 from a traumatic childbirth, and all my childhood abuse came rushing back. The emotional pain was suffocating me, and it took a year to accept I couldn't handle it alone, and like you said - repressing does NOT work. Finally getting the courage to **talk** about it was the first step to healing. You were SO brave to post here and begin the conversation!!! To speak your truth and be honest about your pain. But now it's time to make it real and speak to someone 1:1 who can help you navigate this painful journey of being who you truly WANT to be. It won't be easy, and you need someone who you can confide in, who you feel safe with to be real, and who can support you and give guidance in making some tough choices with your family. And some of their expectations might be \"perceived,\" and not 100% accurate. Fear creates so many \"what ifs\" in our heads, but our fears aren't reliable, nor are they true most of the time. You deserve to live the life you want to live, so please do start your search for someone to talk to, and don't give up on that. It took me EIGHT therapists to finally find one who I connected with and who earned my trust. The first seven made me feel worse. But #8 was my angel. I'm free of it all now and even helping others heal. There is a beautiful life for you ahead!! DO BRAVE and don't quit fighting for the life you want and deserve."

None of us, are defined by our gender.   \nBeing a great big sibling doesn't require you to be seen as a guy.   \nbeing a child they are proud of should not hinge on you being a son, they would have loved you if you were born a girl, right?   \nI'm so sorry you've been put in this hard situation.   \nThe decision is yours.   \nBut I urge you to do the work to become more comfortable with the idea of transition as a concept. Whether that's talking to people, reading about that experience, or getting professional help. it sounds like your very afraid of the concept. Learning to be more familiar the concept, might help you feel less trapped, because you might feel better about that being an option one day.  \n I really hope maybe you can find a way to meet and get to know other trans people. I think the media demonises transness a lot. But people who are trans who I have met, through work, acquaintances, or board games, have always just been very normal people to me. Even if I met them before transition they are still themselves, not a stranger."

If you feel like you need to be someone, then it's what you need to be.

In a nutshell, what helped me was acceptance. \n\nYou didn't choose to have those thoughts. You didn't chose to want to transition. You didn't chose to be judged.

Can you embrace who you were before even if it wasn’t the authentic you and also embrace who you feel like now (and probably felt like then too).  We all change and grow in life. Who I was when I was younger is different than who I am today. I actually like younger me more. I’ve always felt comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth and have no dissonance there like a trans person would have. I’ve never felt overly compelled to be super macho or a man different than I am. I’ve always been fairly sensitive towards others. One could say I like and embrace certain stereotypes of feminine traits. I’m empathetic, I rarely need to flex and prove my manhood but I’m not a Man’s man. \n\nI do understand what it is like to hide parts of myself. These mainly relate to OCD. Most people with OCD are masters at hiding it. It has built in shame and paranoia and doesn’t want to be discovered. If you don’t know me well, you won’t know I have anxiety and OCD. I’m okay with that. Most people don’t need to know. It’s highly misunderstood and exhausting. Disclosure of my mental health issues except to doctors and good friends has almost no utility. I guess being transgender is something that shows on the outside especially to people that knew you before and after you became open about it."

No matter how much the world changes, bends and twists, God remains the same forever and I’d like to add it’s usually the statement that seems the most unappealing and convicting to the individual reading, that is the one that can hold truth - just like vegetables, you might think they’re unflavoured, disgusting, and bland, but it is the most healthiest compared to chocolate cake. It’s the most unpopular opinion that stands out the most, that catches you off guard, that gives you a wake-up call and brings you back to reality. You might not like eating vegetables, but it might be the best decision you’ve ever made."

The restaurant i was working closed their doors.. my wife and I split, both of us are homeless now and a friend is watching our cats as we couch surf. \nI have constant and reoccurring nightmares that she is cheating on me. \nThe worst part of my nightmares is how nonchalant the people in my life are when I plead for help. In my dreams I am frantic and begging at the feet of people who don’t give a fuck about me. I wake up so angry that I’m shaking half the time. I have a hard time trusting a single soul on this planet, which makes it hard to reach out to a professional because not only are they expensive (and even paying for even a month could mean that I don’t eat or have a place to live anymore) but I don’t have faith that they can help me keep my mind from attacking itself. I fear any professional I go to won’t have the tools necessary to untangle my fucked life, and the only thing they can offer me that I can’t already do for myself is drugs. I have tried Xanax before and I really like it but it might be too strong and gives bad side effects (it felt like borrowing happiness from tomorrow)\n I know if I go in and ask specifically for medication I’m gonna look like a junkie.. I’m not btw all I do is smoke weed, I don’t even drink. \nOn top of that the few times I \n tried acid when I was younger still haunts me and I still don’t think my brain is the same as before I did that.. it’s still affecting me to this day. \n\nTLDR; My mind is broken and my body is withering as a result. I trust no one and am too broke to hire a professional \nWtf am I supposed to do? Thanks for listening to me ramble. I fuckin hate my life and hate that even feel inclined to make this post so here it goes. Thanks again for reading.",

Ofc I am sad and I wish she was still here but I find it weird that I can't really cry or well... ANYTHING. If you saw me you wouldn't even be able to tell something like that happend. And I am devastated but for some reason not much of a reaction comes out of me. \nI just think it's weird it hasn't impacted me more and I feel guilty about it because she was close to me. ",

Just a total accident, nobody's fault and her brother ended up with only a few cuts and a black eye, while she had spinal injuries and out of nowhere just didn't make it after a couple days of a coma, despite having her vitals completely stabilize. It was tragic.\n\nI didn't cry the day she died, even though I felt horrible and so desperately wanted to. I didn't cry at the funeral and felt like I was the only one who wasn't. It hit me once in-between the two dates, but then after the funeral it hit me nearly every day. I'd lay down and go to bed, cry a little sometimes. I'd have dreams about her and talking to her, but would wake up and cry knowing it wasn't real. You'll hit a point where you will cry even though the pain on paper could be less, it's just how our bodies are I guess. \n\nThere will be stretches of times where you feel like you're finally over it, but then it hits you sometimes. It's just how it works. It's totally okay not to cry.\n\nI promise you, it gets better."

It just really depends on the person, their past and how they deal with each situation.\n\nSometimes, when our emotions become too much for us to handle, our body may disconnect itself from the emotions. It's so that we are able to continue to function without the emotions debilitating us. \n\nJust give yourself time. Be easy on yourself. Give yourself love and care and take the time to work through your emotions as you feel them. Grief counseling or support is also a great place to gather coping skills and for support."

Which I and everyone else is experiencing with him right now, with me getting the most of it since I'm around him the most and live together.

And she warned me that I will be getting the blunt of it because in a weird way he loves me the most but doesn't think he deserves me so instead he sabotages our relationship. Which could be true or not in his head it's just what his mom has surmised.\n\nI just want to know the best way to help him during this time. I've been super positive with him, trying to make his everyday life as easy as possible, been there physically for him, given him some little surprise gifts and his favorite snacks, tried to just be present in the same room as him when I can see from a mile away he's off and moody. But then around others he's talking and laughing, but just not me. But even then I can tell that this \"happy\" mood is forced and so can the others because they all know something's up because he's not acting like his usual self with me.\n\nAny advice or tips I could try to make this situation better?\n",

        "body": "I apologise to anyone who will be reading this as this will be a long post and it's my first time posting here so forgive me for any mistakes. Like the title, I'm not sure what I feel and idk if I can talk to anyone about it. I don't know if I'm depressed or its something else or it's just normal things. I live in India and if there are any Indians reading this, y'all will know that mental health is still in an iffy situation when it comes to society, with older people still coming to terms with accepting it and still dismissing it as something stupid and youngsters often using it as something cool to be proud of. And in such a situation I'm not sure if what I feel is normal or not. I've got a good life, a great gf who loves me with all her life, good friends, loving parents who are strict but I wouldn't trade them for anyone else. Yet, I constantly feel like utter shit. Anyone who met me wouldn't even think that I constantly have such negative thoughts swirling around in my mind as many have told me that I come off as really confident and nice. Yet every 5 mins, there's a voice in my head telling me that I'm trash and I should kill myself. There are times I'm happy, when I'm with others I feel happy. But underneath all that, all the hate and suicidal thoughts lurk, waiting for the chance for me to be alone again. I do make a lot of jokes about killing myself and honestly sometimes I feel like I'm not even kidding as I say it out loud but obviously no one takes me seriously. I feel like I'm crying for help yet no one can hear me and I simply cannot bring myself to talk to anyone because then it doesn't even feel real anymore. Like I'm somehow faking it for attention yet why do I feel like this when literally no one is there in my head to hear it. I've always had trouble opening up to people and it's more apparent than ever when I'm helping everyone else deal with their problems yet I'm so sorry very close to picking up a knife and carving up parts of my body. I'm always seen as the emotionally and mentally stable one, the one who never panics and always thinks logically. But if people knew who I felt every night, struggling, unable to even make myself fucking cry at this point coz I'm so used to shoving all of my emotions and thoughts so fucking deep down, I wonder what they would think. I take things lightly and try to not let it affect me but idk how much longer I can take. No, I won't kill myself. I know that. But if I keep continuing like this, I wonder if death would be a mercy compared to a life of misery\n\nPS: Honestly this is just me finally picking up the courage to rant about what I actually feel and I can't bring myself to proof read this. So cut me some slack for any confusing sentences. My thoughts are still jumbled.",

After the first episode, I was confused and disoriented for an hour or so. Struggling to speak, forgetting where I was and my name/age, being clumsy.

Write down what you were doing before this event. Write down all these symptoms you listed here. Next time you have what you normally consider a panic attack, do the same thing- write that shit down.

Hyperventilation is a bitch and really scary if you're not used to it. Practising mindfulness meditation breathing techniques can really help. I've had PTSD for a long time and I'm also chronically ill,  AFAB and a wheelchair user with ancient self harm scars. I know what it's like when doctors treat you like a hysterical woman but this time I really do think they're right.

I could tell you to focus on stuff you like to get a better feeling on stuff you do, to kinda get a bit of motivation back. Like drawing or making music, anything you like. Or maybe there was a hobby you had as a kid, but sadly gave up on it. Or maybe try something new? Like writing a novel or baking? \n\nI can recommend, cause i would guess you think a lot, do a little walk and listen to some music. I usually go alot on nightwalks that can go like over 5hours by just walking through the empty streets from the city i live in. Its calming down and helps me get my head empty. Sure my problems dont go away, but its defently a difference by thinking while walking than thinking in school/work. I got myself into reading again, now i read some novels while im at a park at night.\n\nDont look back on bad stuff that happend, like things you might feel miserable or your childhood or sm. Focus more on stuff you actually enjoy, try to make conversations. I know its hard. I cant even do that. And thats why i am here, to get my social status filled. I write more on reddit than i talk with people irl.\n\nYoure not horrible. I guess your just going Through a Tough time. I would assume you are inside a not happy deep hole, trapped out of reach. Try to get out of your situation and find yourself.\n\nWhat makes you feel like a horrible person? Did you loose a person? Are you struggling finding things that make you happy? You stressed out at work and dont know what to do?\n\nIts normal to struggle with things. Thats how we grow and learn. Humans are not perfect. Imagine everyone is perfect and the same normal. Would be boring, dont you think? \n\nYour struggles, your feelings, your mind, your relationships, your body, your soul, your everything is that what makes you you. You are the one in control of your own.\n\nI know, there are people, like me, out there that would be there for you, even when its just writing in a privat chat on reddit.

That night the old flame of love between his sister and me was reignited, she is 14, almost 15, now and I am 17. I think that now its morally okay to have something romantically going on. We tried keeping it a secret but her parents noticed. They are okay with our relationship which made me very happy. But my friend noticed it yesterday and is furious. I really love her but I feel extremely ashamed and guilty now, I lost my best friend, a brother which I trusted more than my own family. I don't know what I should do, I feel like I should give up the relationship, but I love her and it would all have been for nothing. I don't expect anybody here to be able to help me. I just wanted to get it off my soul. Thanks for reading this.\n\n\nEdit: A relationship would be 100% legal, even if I turn 18. I live in Austria, u can have an 3 year gap as long as both are over 14 and aren't forced ofc",

Depending on where you live could you run into legal trouble once you turn 18? Legality aside, the maturity level between 14 and 17 is pretty drastic. When it comes to morality I’d think it’d be better to wait until she’s an adult to move further with her. I don’t blame the brother for having his concerns."

Truth is, these days you're living now, seem like hell, but are in fact the BEST days of your life. Later on you'll do nothing but search for any little bit of memory of these moments.

You're opening up to someone you've never met and they're still trying to get to know you. Doing virtual therapy is also a bit different of a vibe than in person. If it's possible, you may want to try meeting them in person and see how the session goes. Also, the first session is an intake session and it doesn't feel like therapy. I would still give it a go and do a few more sessions and see how it feels. Sometimes it takes some time to find a groove and comfortableness with therapy and the therapist. It's also okay to tell the therapist that you are a little nervous, not sure what to say or what they would like to know. They are trained and are aware that this might be a possibility. But if it's not told to them, they may not immediately see it. Unfortunately, we're not mind readers. So don't be afraid to tell them what's really going on in your mind. They can't break confidentiality unless you are putting  yourself at risk or someone else. And others who have said that you also may feel this way because stirring up hard things you're struggling with isn't pleasant, is true!"

I liked to go for a walk in the park for 20-30 minutes after my sessions with a nice drink or a snack to decompress. \n\n\nRemember, the point of therapy isn't to make you feel better right now, it's meant to teach you and train you to feel better in the future. One of the reasons people drop therapy is because they have to face a lot of the difficult things they've been unaware of or actively avoiding. We kinda have to tackle those difficult things in order to move past them. Part of the process will also be learning to feel more okay with these difficult, uncomfortable feelings, so you won't feel \"bad\" because you got stressed, cried, are overthinking things and so on. As I was told, there aren't any good or bad emotions, they just are."

I’m the youngest and lowest ranking in the unit. While the ones I work with are fine coworkers, I just don’t “vibe” with them like I did friends/coworkers back home or how my other friend also AD Army does with her coworkers. My first line leader (immediate supervisor) has 6 kids, 2 of them are my age. It’s difficult to connect and talk about anything outside of work with him, or any others. There’s also that, I have almost nothing going on outside of work. My current unit has a high operational tempo and we move bases often, giving briefs, training and field support all over the continental USA. Staying in hotels and using rentals/government vehicles at the bases we go too. So it’s hard to find friends or people to hangout/talk with. Inside or outside of work. I also can’t bring my PC so no gaming with friends. The most recent non work conversation I’ve had with someone around the same age at me was with a MP (military police) officer who selected my vehicle for a random search at the gate. My days of working aren’t any better either. I’m working 6-7 days a week. Hours vary quite a lot tho. But I’m not even doing anything remotely related to the job I signed up for and am trained on. When I am back at my actual duty station (where I am assigned) I have to sit through briefs, get retrained on shit etc. I’ve put in for leave a few times trying to match family/friends scheduled to have it denied because there’s some “essential operation” and that I’m “essential” or “mandatory brief/training” there’s almost no gaps in our schedule that doesn’t have one of these events. And where their are gaps I’m probably the last one to get picked because I’m lowest on the flag pole and “don’t have a family.” I just put in another leave request to attend my grandmothers funeral. I was unable to visit her at the hospital and was her only child/grandchild not to do so. And one of two child/grandchild to not be there when she passed. I can’t talk to my coworkers about any of this for previously mentioned reasons. And some of them are just assholes/hardasses. I’ve tried talking to the command team and a chaplain and received no help. I’ve heard “the Army requires sacrifice” to many damn times. If I go to mental health services offered on post I risk loosing my security clearance. I’m not suicidal or anything but that’s what my command team told me. \n\nIt’s also nearly impossible to maintain a relationship or even start one. I have no idea how my coworkers do it. I guess there’s a reason most are divorced or unhappy in their marriages. \n\nI’ve got so much I could rant about but also a lot to be glad for. I just saw some old live photos of my friends group and hearing us all laughing together and having a genuinely good time together just made me realize how much I missed it. I’m proud of the work I do and do genuinely enjoy it often. Sorry if I made grammar mistakes or it was hard to follow. Just typed what came to mind. Thank you for reading!\n",

        "body": "Hi all new here. I recently started seeing a therapist (within the last year) for attention issues (either totally disassociating or hyper fixating), anxiety, and what I call my “zoomies” \nFor the past few years, I’ve had this weird thing where I’ll have crazy energy and a full body feeling that I HAVE to be doing something (zoomies), then within an hour or so it disappears to wanting to lay there and then mentally crap talking myself (lazy, worthless, etc.). It comes and goes by day, and it is one extreme to the other. When I have those “zoomies” I ignore everyone and everything around me and if you interrupt me I get incredibly upset, like full body anger, then I just crash and sit or lay there stewing away and I totally disassociate from my surroundings and get into my head. Aside from that I’m incredibly anxious about everything and it has evolved into repetitive behaviors. Ex- anxious I didn’t lock the door, I have to get up, check it three times before I can fall asleep or it eats me away. I’ve brought up all these things to my therapist and they think it is cyclothymic disorder. I was told to make lifestyle changes and go from there. Past few months I’ve limited caffeine, developed a daily exercise routine, and set a firm bedtime. Hasn’t helped. I feel it is getting worse, but my therapist keeps telling me to give it time. I’m not a confrontational person so I’m scared to advocate for myself on this! Has anyone ever experienced this hurdle before and/or these feelings/actions?? ",

        "body": "I’ve never recall posted on reddit before but I’m always seeing post their problems here and I figured what the hell why not. \n\nFirstly I’m going through a breakup that I poured my heart and soul into. I couldn’t control my emotions and always let them get the best of me. From accusing her of cheating to making stupid assumptions. However, I do think she took advantage of me when it came to money. In a nutshell, I spent way more money on her than she did on me and that’s a downright fact. I alone had to pay a sum of $2000 because we moved out after breaking up. I’m not entirely too sure how I feel about it all but I do know that in some aspects of the relationship it wasn’t fair to either of us. She went on to say that she still loved me and wanted me, just for her to say later that “things change” and we “both want different things” what a joke.\n\nSecond. I had to move back in with my mom and siblings (4 other siblings) so you can imagine the privacy I had to let go of. On top of all of that she’s drowning in debt which I’m sure as hell is going to get passed onto her children because she cannot stop vaping for the life of her. She doesn’t show to care about her kids but only when it comes to easy things like cooking, none of the other stuff like mental health or physical, even educational. Im the 2nd oldest and my older brother isnt any better than my mom. He goes out partying when he gets the chance and comes back drunk. Like what kind of example are you showing??\n\nThird. I invested in the whole “meme stock” thing back in 2021. Didn’t sell and now my life savings has gone from about $11,000 down to a measly $1000. It’s excruciating to think about but I try to find hope that maybe I’ll break even again one day. \n\nI guess that’s really it. Like I said, I’ve never really been one to post my problems anywhere on social media but I’m genuinely at a point in my life where I feel so hopeless\n",

I really thought I was going to. I had the stuff ready and in my car and I was Just planning which day to do it. But I had a doctors appointment and the ounce of me that was still fighting told her, and I ended up involuntary hospitalized for 10 days. Yeah it was scary, but also not so bad either. I had to report an employee and talk to the police about the employee who was supposed to be keeping me safe coming into my room and touching me though. Meds were adjusted and I'm feeling much better now. I'm still fighting, sure, but I can breathe much easier now. My worst fear saved my life.",

Basically the situation of my mental health is down bad, I have meds for agoraphobia, anxiety and depression so I'm treated but I just started first theraphy. So nothing is okay rn bc my family aunt, uncle cousins hate me they think I don't have a job because I'm just lazy and I'm making it up to not work which is not true cuz I already worked in 3 jobs which the last one was even okay.   \nSo my cousin send me an advertisement of a help for kitchen and making food in food track. At the begininng I was like i don't know bc I don't think so I can do it, I'm scared etc etc. But my unlce (which I'm scared of bc he almost everytime screaming at anyone) I picked up his call and he said that it would be okey If I'll go, it's close and they need someone. So I was like alright I can go but I'm pissin myself from anxiety (I literally had diarhea before going I'm that scared of jobs). But anyways I got there I talked with the men it was okay he described me how and what and where, how many money I get for hour etc.   \nBasically he said to me (and I think we both misunderstood ourself with the food track boss) that I will be too the end of march but it come out when I called him, that he wants me to have a trial to the end of march not end job at the ending of it.   \nMy cousin write to my grandma that I'm lying that I don't really want job and I'm lying scum and there was another person (cousin friend that works tere) . I write to her that why she said that to my grandma it not true that I was just talking with the nice guy he said that I will work to the end of march (witch that's why I called him bc to know 100% what he ment, which now I'm understand)  \nAlso she started saying that I'm lying that I'm lazy don't want job and my grandma doing everthing for me cleaning cooking etc (which is not true either pff) I said to her that my mental health is not good at all and that's why I didn't got any job and that I'm very suicidal everyday I'm thinking about killing myself and I'm not doing well that's why it's not lazyness, which she said that I need help etc and still was saying that I'm lying and it's all just excuse. Which after she write all that I have BIG meltdown I screamed and cried my lungs off  and I cut myself in arm while having this tantrum (which they are not deep but I was clean from SH like 3 years) Everyday is getting worse I just want to vanish but I can't bc I care about my pets they just hold me in that world. Do yall have any tips what to do how to stop thinking about this whole converstaion. My brain gonna exhaust me with overthinking.",

She posts cuts on herself and tweets she is excited for her new blades and laxatives, ive tried to help her so many times but she just wants me to support her in what shes doing and to leave her alone. Im asking my other friend (who ill call chloe) if i should report her and i showed her all the tweets but she is telling me to just leave her alone and that she can deal with it herself.

TW a few weeks ago i couldn't begin to cope with anything and resorted to self harm. i find comfort in a teacher of mine, she treats me like a daughter, shes so lovely and i find any excuse to spend time with her after school (extra work, or completing work) i know this post is a lot to read but i need help.. what can i do? my sister was diagnosed with depression and my mother AND step father do not believe this. they say 'what have you to be depressed about?' and its 'all in your head' this is all hard to explain but i'd be happy to answer any questions.. there is a lot more to this but i do not want to write a lot.. not as much as i have already put. i need help.. i am just stuck.",

But I was hoping to get some advice, lately it’s been terrible. Tbh I’ve been in a weird state since around October and all the changes in my life have made me feel all alone going to a new school, \n\nnot having any close friends and feeling distant from my family. It all kind of started when my brother got a girlfriend obviously I have no problem with it and I’m happy for him and she’s a nice person but she’s around here nearly everyday and it has definitely changed him though I don’t want to sound like a prick because I knew he had to mature sometime but maybe it’s just the autism in me that has a hard time dealing with the change as I don’t see him as much and he was one of my main sources of relief as he’s basically my best friend.\n My mental health is always up and down most days I’m fine but it’s rare that I have a great day and sometimes one thing can set me off and throw me into depression. Lately it’s gotten worse in the past month or so, I started getting suicidal thoughts and feeling extreme loneliness and lack of self-worth. Self esteem has always been an issue for me and my constant struggle to fit in with the crowd. I’m also pretty fat aswell so that doesn’t help.\n It kind of scares me because I know how and where I would kill myself.\n\n And I’ve been pondering for a while now if there will ever be a time in my 20s where things don’t get better no matter how hard I try and I’ll just end up doing it. Last month was the first time I cut myself don’t know why I did it ; I felt extreme pain and sadness and just wanted to let the pain out and sometimes I want to punish myself for things I’ve done in the past. \nI haven’t done it again as it scared me too much as I realised I’ve finally gotten to this point and it terrified me. I usually get better in the summer but it’s a daily struggle right now. And I keep thinking if I had a girlfriend all my problems would be solved but most likely it would bring about different problems. And I still struggle with my ocd too but I’m still hanging in there with the support of my family. I just don’t understand why it’s gotten so bad I’ve thought about suicide in a recreational way before but why has it gotten so bad this year when I’m turning 17.\n\nNot asking for any serious advice just wondering if anyone could give me any tips to get me through the days until I can get some professional help.\n",

Keep waiting that my mental health will get better by gym or meditation or start taking meds? \nPeople who are taking meds experience a lot of symptoms that's why I don't want to use them but still i want a good mental health where i don't have to fight my brain every day.\n\nAny advice would mean a lot bcs sometimes I feel so tired and think maybe death will free me from it. \n\nThank you for reading ",

        "body": "Blog Post- https://www.wearethestarsmusic.com/post/sacred-circuitry  \nSacred Circuits are very powerful symbols specifically designed to reprogram your brain. Do not underestimate how effective these are at rewiring your neurological pathways in a “hyper-conductive” manner. This allows information to simultaneously flow in both directions linking the higher self & physical mind more efficiently and improving overall communication.  \nThere are 3 Levels to the reception of information in physical reality:  \nHigher Mind- Conceiver  \nPhysical Brain- Receiver (Antenna)  \nPhysical Mind- Perceiver  \nYou perceive what the physical brain/antenna receives from the higher mind. The physical mind & brain have never conceived of 1 thought or concept EVER! Everything comes 100% from the non-physical higher mind. This exercise assures your receiver/antenna is operating at peak levels by merging both hemispheres and cleaning your brain of any blockages like a vibrational car wash.  \nDirections: Look at each one for 1 minute (In order from left to right, top to bottom) and allow yourself to feel the different states of each symbol, feel the activation of these states, observe and absorb each symbol and the concept attached as you go through them. It only takes 15 minutes to reprogram your brain to be more sensitive to higher vibrational energy and function as a more loving, holistic, multidimensional being with a broader view than just the physical. The brain is like plastic and can be rewired/remolded after only 15 minutes. You are this flexible and this powerful!  \nDo this for 3 days in a row (in order for 1 min each) for a stronger and deeper initial impact and after that you can go out of order or just focus on 1 or a few symbols you are attracted to. If you wish to still go in order every time, that works. Always keep it to 15 minutes, even if you are using a few symbols and you can do it up to 3 times per day. Do not go over 15 minutes or over 3x/day as the brain needs time to fully absorb and process the info, any more may burn you out or just waste time.  \nThese symbols are extraterrestrial in origin and were handed down from the Sirians to the Sassani and the Sassani gave this gift to us. Knowing these symbols are not from Earth / this reality is another bonus to help trigger the brain into an optimal, holistic, broader state.  \nYoutube video of exercise- https://youtube.com/watch?v=wczOVT0AsdQ  \nFollow on IG: https://www.instagram.com/firstcontactus",

        "body": "Hi everyone. You can call me Walt, but that's not my real name. And English is not my native language, so I can make mistakes in the text, but I will try to avoid them.\r  \n\r  \nI want to talk about some unpleasant things for me.\r  \n\r  \nI was born in the 2000s in Russia and yes, I am Russian. I was born at a very difficult time for my family. My dad died 8 days before I was born. His name was Arthur. I don't know him at all, only from stories. I was raised by his mother and she was very offended by my mother. She said that my mother killed him because she deliberately drove him to have a stroke in order to start a relationship with a friend of my father's who owned a business. But my mother did not succeed, because this friend rejected her and called her a witch. As a result, 3.5 years later she married another man, who is now neither my stepfather nor my two older sisters. His grandmother said that he was not going to be a stepfather, because the state pays money for the loss of his father in the family. It's about $209 per month or not per month, I do not know.\r  \n\r  \nIn fact, my mother has a mental disorder. She is a mentally ill person. I didn't believe it before, but now everything is falling into place. When I grew up, I became convinced of this. For example, when my two sisters and I were little, she punished us with extreme cruelty. She tore out our hair, threw us against the wall. Once she punished me by plunging my head into a filled bathtub and when I felt that I would soon lose consciousness, I raised my head with all my might and screamed for help. After that, I don't remember what happened next, but I remember it very much. I was 7 or 8 years old at the time and I don't remember what I was being punished for. So it went on for a very long time. All my childhood, until I became a teenager\r  \n\r  \nBut that wasn't the only problem. My oldest sister has schizophrenia. I felt very sorry for her and I wanted to help her. No one treated her. She had seizures and at those times I couldn't be sure that I would stay alive. She tried to kill me. And I do not know why only me. She literally promised me that one day I would die at her hands. But the way she did it is a separate story. But it was only after so many years that she was taken to a mental hospital. She was discharged from there a month later. She was diagnosed with a childhood type of schizophrenia. She recently had a birthday, she turned 20 years old. But I don't communicate with anyone else. I stopped communicating with my grandmother too. At first, everyone thought I was selfish, but now no one cares.\r  \n\r  \nI stopped communicating because I was tired. I'm tired of listening to swearing in my direction every time. I was kicked out of my house once because I confessed that I was an atheist and my family was very religious. But the relationship broke off completely when my grandmother found out that I was not good at the Russian government and that I was for democracy. She wanted me to become an employee of the special services like my grandfather, but I want to do science. I really love astronomy and physics. I really want to connect my life with this.\r  \n\r  \nI'm learning to program and I'm building different things. For example, I built a drone. At first I built it out of plumbing and it could fly, but then I was able to buy a good drone frame. But when I was transferring everything to another frame, I accidentally burned the board. I'm fixing it now.\n\n\r\r  \nOne day I decided that I want to work at SpaceX or NASA. I have engineering projects that I want to implement there when I get my education.\r  \n\r  \nBut it's very difficult to get together and just work when no one cares about me and my ideas. Everyone really thinks that I won't be able to, because these are just dreams. Some people openly call me dumb and weird. I do not know why everyone dislikes me so much. I try not to think about it. But it's very hard. In November, I decided to hang myself. But the belt I was hanging on broke off. I couldn't come to my senses for several minutes, as I almost suffocated. Then I just cried. It hurts so much. I don't even have anyone to tell about it. I have no friends. I had a friend, but then we lost each other when I moved in. I write and call him sometimes, but he never starts communicating first. I realized that he just didn't want to talk to me. I also loved a girl. It seemed to be mutual, because she hinted to me that she loved me. We talked a lot, but after I told my story, she stopped talking to me. I have no one. I spend all day alone. I've been trying to make friends with someone, but everyone thinks I'm weird. I'm thinking of killing myself. No one will care anyway. Unless my family stops receiving money through me. They will definitely worry about this. Maybe if someone sees this post, I'll answer any questions. Maybe I can talk to someone before I die.",

I have no goals. I don't even know what goals I could set because I am truly just lost. I feel absolutely fucking shit. Distracting myself doesn't work anymore. I'm just sitting here waiting to die eventually, whenever that is. I can't remember the days. I can't keep track of anything. Everything's just a blur and all I can think about is how I dread tomorrow and the week ahead. There is no happiness. I truly cannot express my feelings because I don't even know what they are. Fucking hell this shit sucks. I can't do it anymore. I'm driving myself insane. And it's not like I'm in a bad situation. I'm able to have food water electricity a place to live ECT, so I don't understand why I feel so fucked up. Like, why can't I just be happy like the rest of em? God I hate myself. ",

        "timestamp": "2024-03-07T19:10:38",
        "body": "The older I've gotten, the more I've become annoyed with the world...in a variety of ways. But the thing that grinds my fucking gears beyond belief is the shortage of ADHD medication. This is my breaking point.\n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD and started medication in 2018, in my first year of college. I saw my pediatrician to begin medication to treat my ADHD and he put me on Vyvanse (also as recommended by another friend with ADHD who had luck with Vyvanse). Since 2018, I have almost consistently taken Vyvanse. There are two reasons why I mean almost. The first is that I honestly struggled (and at times still do) to take my medication consistently and for a number of reasons. The second is that, although I liked Vyvanse, at some point I thought I should try another stimulant just to see if it was better. I tried Ritalin and I hated it. The best way to describe it is that it made me feel like the squirrel from Ice Age...I felt like it was acting as a party drug and not a drug whose purpose was to help me function during the day.\n\nSo now let's fast forward to more recently. At the end of December 2023/early January of this year, I needed to refill my prescription for my 60mg Vyvanse. After calling about 12 different pharmacies who didn't even have the generic Vyvanse (what I had been taking for the past couple of months), I spoke to the final pharm tech who said something along the lines of \"I don't think we will get Vyvanse again. If I were you, I would switch to another medication.\" Well, after a couple more calls, I actually did find a pharmacy who carried Vyvanse (generic), and paid $115 more than usual to get it.\n\nI realized that Vyvanse might not be a part of my life much longer and I felt frustrated and helpless. A few weeks after, I spoke with my psychiatrist and said I think I needed to try other options because of the Vyvanse shortage. I expressed that the only other medication I had taken was Ritalin and that I did not like it. So what does she put me on? Concerta...like Ritalin, it's also *methylphenidate*. So then at my most recent appointment I said that I had the same Ice-Age-squirrel-like side effects and wanted to try something else. What did she put me on now? Focalin...which I found out after the appointment is...dex*methylphenidate*.\n\nThese aren't working. Nothing is working. Except Vyvanse. Vyvanse worked. And you know what? I'm so fucking proud of myself because I was doing so well with my medication and taking it consistently. I *finally* surpassed that feeling of resentment for my medications. But here I am again, trying new medications and feeling like I'm setting myself back. I mean...I'm finally in my final year of college. ADHD has ruined my life and my medications were instrumental in saving it. My medications have allowed me to actually sit down and work, to focus, to not procrastinate as much, to think and understand what I'm thinking. And now, I'm having to explain to tell my professors \"Hey sorry I didn't turn that in, it's not that I don't care, it's just that I'm not able to get my normal medication and the ones that I am on make me sleep a heinous amount.\n\nI'm tired of struggling. I'm tired of this fucking shortage. I want to feel like myself again and it's so fucking hard to stay positive and keep going through all of this.",

        "body": "I usually write here whenever I'm distressed, but now I'll try to do it with a clear head. \n\nI (28f) feel abnormally lost in life... Or at least it's abnormal in my way of seeing things. By this age I thought that I would either not exist or, if I somehow did, that I'll be a well adjusted individual. Obviously neither is the case.\n\n\nNamely, I feel as the title says and I'll try to describe why that is... I work at a job that is practically a receptionist so my contact with people is limited. I prefer this compared to the more chaotic office jobs where there is a lot of people, but it does get very boring. With all honesty, I'm not a true misanthrope and I'm aware that it's logically impossible for everyone to be manipulative and amoral... But whenever I try to communicate with others I'm weary, but not in a normal way. I'm stuck up and unsure of what to say because I either panic or feel like they don't want to talk to me. Sometimes I yearn for being able to talk freely like I used to as a child, but that can never be again because I don't have the brain I used to. I have gotten so dumb and forgetful, it's honestly embarrassing to think of how much I've fallen. I used to be one of those people who noticed everything and remembered the details, but now I barely do my job right. I know I'm even made fun of for that by my colleagues, one person said so to me and I wasn't surprised, but still it hurt. I was supposed to be highly educated, it was the only thing going for me since I know for myself, and I failed myself even there (I had bad depression when I started attending uni, so I dropped out). \n\nNow, me coping with my shrinking IQ aside, I want to explain why I'm a fake misanthrope. Basically, even though I think human nature is inherently cruel and self-serving, I am still able to know that there are people who aren't like that.... And I'm especially prone to believing those people are exactly the ones I'm talking to. It's, once again, embarrassing just how easily I'm influenced by seemingly bubbly people, just for them to do a 180° turn and leave me sobbing. I'm aware it's a normal human thing to experience, but to this extent? I do have two friends who I would give my all to and I know they would help me as well, but that's all....and I changed so many people in my life.\n\nYes, I'm aware that I am a common denominator and in fact that's exactly why I think I'm stupid for friendly relationships.\n\n\nRomantic relationships, you ask? I'm not even sure how I managed to have the few partners that I did. Not only am I objectively unattractive, but while I was going out I've always been either stuck up or crude (back when I used to drink a bit more). Come to think of it, my only long-term and sexual relationship was even started because I had horrible depressive episodes and decided to ask my friend to be my fwb... It didn't end well for various reasons, we both made mistakes (long story short: I refused a relationship at first and then when I caught feelings and accepted it, my partner started ghosting me and flirting with others so I became possesive and eventually broke up with them). \n\nAt the bottom of my soul, if I even have one, I think I'm just as bad as other people, I'm just too scared and weak to show it so openly. I want to be loved so bad, that I go about life cosplaying some saint. People tell me that it's not true and that I actually a good person, but I know I'm not.... And maybe, just maybe, being an outcast is some sort of karma because I don't deserve to be my true self... \n\n\nSome days I feel completely at peace with all of these conclusions (as long as I don't force myself to think about it) and I think that just existing is ok and that internet/media will fill all the void in my heart, but other days I feel myself slipping lower and lower, and I've genuinely never felt this sad even though I'm not nearly as suicidal as before.",

We had a lot of common, in gaming, ideology, vehicle stuff, lots in common.\n\nAfter we both moved some distance away we stayed in touch, paying video games mainly, sending ads to each other, meme and I visited when I could as it was a 2 hour highway drive as he did not have a vehicle.\n\nI noticed his search for a vehicle was needful as he walked to work, his mental state was going down hill ,and didn't possess a full driving license. I'm a kind hearted person so I offered to help him in his search for a vehicle. He wanted a truck in the city on  his already tight budget.\n\nI tried to convince him to buy a car but he went with a truck. He saw a truck online that stuck with him. After he settled and bought a truck that needed new rockers, floors, 2 cab mounts, with thd mentality of he can fix it, which he can and did later.\n\nAfter helping him going out of my way of several hours of traveling here, there and every where. His truck was on the road with the help of me knowing a guy who can do safety and look the other way on some issues but not all for obvious reasons.\n\nHe encountered issues 2 to 4 weeks after he got his truck home and I did my best to diagnose the issues over the phone and in some cases go down and visited to help attempt to fix some issues, find parts like fuel tanks on the cheap that won't fall apart.\n\nAfter a 8 months the truck ran great with no issues of mainly his work, 90 percent good, this is where maybe he can tow a truck for me cause the trucks in a state over don't use heavy salt and alot cleaner\n\nHe offered if I wanted a tow like to get a truck of my own from a distance away as long as I paid for fuel and snacks which is very respectable.\n\nThe problem accords when I wanted to get something he couldn't for x y z of small issues with his truck. Like the brakes got a little squeak to them, or the transmission doesn't want to shift properly when he tows and only when he tows (he towed for a another friend), he needs a new filler neck cause it has a small hole in it. Or the Ac don't work, name a small issue he milked it. \n\nI did ask if he could help me with some smaller things that he has the tools at his shop (and policy allows it) if he could remove some bed liner material/ under coating rubber off some parts a set of long control arms for a suv, he accepts and it sat in a shed never touched and lied on why he never touched them.\n\n5 months later\n\nIt would seem he just didn't want to help me after I help him out. Now he did offer again, and when I asked, he couldn't for the same reasons that have t been touched in 6 months and was willing to help his other buddy's out when they needed help.\n\nOne night I just felt used, betrayed and taken advantage of, cut all communications off socal media, video game platforms and removed him from my phone.\n\nI received one text from him of \"is everything alright\" and I ignored it nothing else after that.\n\nWhat I want to know did I make the right choice of cutting communications, it's been 8 months since and I do think about it every now and again.\n\n",

        "body": "so my partner (M18) and I (M18) have been living in my MIL's apartment/house for a year now. We appreciate her giving it away for us as she lives at her partner's house. At first we didnt think that it would be a problem since we assumed everything was fine in their relationship but throughout the year she has come back here when things got bad with her partner and stayed for 2-3 days then leave. We dont have an issue with that of course because its her house and she pays the rent for us since we are still in highschool and we cant really work (we are in Europe). What started to bother us is that whenever she stayed her she expected things to go HER way, not taking into account that, since my partner and I have been living here for a while, things have changed (things are in different places, we have a different routine for cleaning and such). Despite accommodating to her and being respectful it is still not enough for her. Not only that she has become emotionally abusive to my partner as well. Bringing him down, being rude to him and making him feel like total crap. What is worse tho is that despite her partner (an alcoholic) being emotionally and physically abusive to her, she denies that he has ever done that to her OR that it is completely normal. Her partner has threatened my partner to hit him multiple times and yet she denies it. She brings him to family occasions knowing that he is abusive. My partner and his sister (24) tried talking to her about it and put some boundries but she always lashes out and starts blaming everyone that it is their fault except for her partner. My partner is struggling really bad because everytime he wanted to talk to her she would threaten she would stop paying rent for us - we have nowhere to go and rent nowadays is expensive and we each only get 150€ a month from child support, which is barely enough for groceries and bus cards. We cannot work because we are in our last year in highschool and it is the most stressful year. On top of that we have a cat and a rabbit to take care of as well and not a lot of apartments are pet-friendly. I was thinking of getting a gap year in between highscool and college to save up some money for an apartment but to do that in a year it won't be enough. Does anybody have any advice? ",

Has anyone else experienced this?\n\nI am a female, in my 20s and I've been in a relationship with my SO for 3 years. Last week I cheated on him with a guy I recently met. It was a mistake, and I know I should feel horrible, but I don't. I don't feel guilty about pretending it didn't happen. I lie regularly to my friends and family, and don't care if I hurt them. I am scared at my lack of remorseful emotion. It frightens me. When something bad, or something sad happens, I pretend to care because that's what is expected, but unless it effects me directly I feel nothing, which I know is selfish... Which I know is wrong but doesn't make me feel bad dispite knowing that.\n\nPlease don't tell me I am a bad person or judge me, I know that what I did is wrong and it's bad to hurt people, but I just feel numb. I don't feel happy or proud of what I did, I feel nothing. I still feel good emotions, and feel sad when something happens to me, but I can't rember the last time I felt empathy.\n\nI have looked online for help, but most of what I find is linked to antisocial disorder, which is linked to crimminal activity or childhood issues, neither of which apply to me. I had a perfectly happy and normal upbringing, and have never experienced any real hardships.\n\nI just want to know if there is anything I can do, or if anyone else has experienced this before?\"\n\nmy addition: this applies to me very well except for one glaring exception: i had an extreme level of guilt and shame for things that, looking back, weren't even issues at all. i remember watching a youtube video that featured a \"naked\" character for a few seconds (it was like 5 pale pixels) and i was ridden with strong guilt for months. i was about 11 then. i would always run to my parents and confess after a day or two of agonized guilt. since i was 13 or so, i have flipped to the opposite extreme, often lying for no reason, drinking, or neglecting my education, and having not the slightest trace of guilt. i manipulate others because i see no point in pursuing a relationship in which i can't be provided something in exchange for my effort. it just seems illogical to me to do things because of emotions instead of practical benefits. i am not sure which extreme was better.",

I'm so happy, I just can't stop smiling. \nLast Sunday I was at a concert, I'm listening to the set list again and it makes me so happy. The weather outside is beautiful, the birds are singing, and the trees are starting to bloom, I went on a walk and sat in my favourite French bake store, got some treats to go and drank a coffee there. The dogs people take on walks are so cute. The sun is nice and warm, but not too hot. Today is just so beautiful. I feel great. I really didn't believe days like this were gonna come, but here they are.   \n\nSo please remember that a mental illness might make you believe no good time will come and it's never gonna get better, but that's really just the mental illness. Please at least, in the back of your mind  know for a fact that you can somehow get through this, that it will be beautiful. And you don't have to do something special. If you don't have the energy to actively get better right now, just do your best on surviving until you do have the energy to get better and some things might get better on their own. Even if all you can do right now is lay I bed and sleep. Even if you're weak, you can get better.  ",

Would that therapist be aware of who you are and the fact that their wife is your teacher ? If no, go and you can try to keep it that way.

I know she’s overly stressed out with her family issues and her troubled life she’s had. We’re currently long distance right now and something has come up with her strict and hostile parents that she’s not really allowed to speak with me and she tries and does so anyways. She’s told me she’s never felt like this before and it’s worrying her. She’s dealt with depression before and has multiple issues with mental problems such as ADHD, BPD, Schizophrenia, Social Anxiety and more. I feel like she’s experiencing this more extensively because she’s in a relationship with me and she’s told me that I give her the motivation in life to keep going and all. I’m trying my best to be there for her and help comfort her, but I want to know if there’s anything I should or can do to try and help her regain her feelings and emotions back?

It’s been so hard to encourage myself to eat, get an education and just do good. I can’t even remember who I am, my memories feel like someone else’s if I can even remember them ya know. My remembrance of spelling and basic math and special moments have all been leaving my mind, it’s a horrible feeling and idk why it’s happening. I’m so scared to share my thoughts and issues I feel like he’ll see me differently. I mean how can u not? My thoughts sounds like a completely different person from me. Anyways I don’t think I’m up for this job interview I’ll probably blow it. I can’t form a reason why I should get the job or what skills and talents I have to offer or even what my past jobs are. Feels like my mind gets lost, I’m blank. I’m in flight or fight and will prolly have a manic episode or whatever my therapist calls them, whatever it is, it makes me feel indifferent to myself like a disconnect from my mind and body. Like my emotions and personality shift but I’m not a completely different person? Cant even explain to them what the job is I’m applying for. I hate myself. I’m even scared for them to look at my face like they’ll secretly know something is off about me. Like that instinct gut feeling u get. Also my dog keeps making a mess and I only have a few hours to sleep. I need some sleep so I can drive and collect myself. Which if I want to sleep and get ready it won’t give me enough time to clean up after my dog. can’t let my dog live in a mess while I’m gone either. I didn’t know much about the job but I didn’t want to be deadweight and have all his work for extra money go to me not having a job instead of saving or things we rlly need. Every time I have ptsd or extreme stress I start feeling ants crawling after. forgot what it’s called- it’s tactile hallucinations I believe? One of the senses but ik it’s not real but I’m not going to an interview with me acting crazy and crying in there but maybe I will try, if I feel better idk. This season of my life has been horrible such bad luck. If anyone read this. Thanks, it means a lot to be heard. Ur prolly a beautiful person if ur kind enough to care to read this.",

For example if you feel like you'll do badly, don't be telling yourself you won't. Don't be telling yourself anything in this context, because whatever you'd say to yourself would spiral into negativity. So not telling yourself anything gives no power to your brain to scare you."

        "body": "i understand this sadly. sophomore/junior year my mental health took an incredible decline and became so bad (still is lol) to the point where i was having at least 3/4 panic attacks a day and would sometimes spent the entire school day holed up in the bathroom crying my eyes out of no reason but also every reason, i couldnt even see the school without bursting into tears. no one really understood and middle of junior year after i would stay home for days to weeks i decided to drop out because i couldnt take it anymore. wasnt easy and my parents have never been understanding of mental health and illness which made it much worse, but my boyfriend has always been as helpful as he can be (dont be afraid to rant or lean on your husbands shoulders. i feel as though i hold my boyfriend down and exhaust him at times too, sometimes i forget to check up on him because im so worried about myself. so check up on his mental health too and remind yourself if your husband knows of the troubles you have to go through daily, he will be there for you and understand) come all the way to present, i am now diagnosed depression, anxiety, ptsd, and suspected bipolar II. in some ways im better and in most ways im not. my parents push me to get a job, finish my education, etc. but it feels impossible because it feels like pure hell to live each day, how can i worry about any of those things. i feel worthless and sometimes cant leave the house for weeks. it feels like my brain is mush sometimes (brain fog and dissociation is a bitch) i wanted to mention this not to compare but so you know you are not alone. but what has helped me understand and heal myself little by little and may help you, Is to understand why we feel the way we do (or try), do research, connect with your spiritual self/meditating (helps heal trauma and open your mind in ways nothing else can and even if we can find peace for just a quick second its worth it), a journal (sounds dumb i know but trust me recording your progress or just ranting about how you feel helps you not bottle it up so much), try to be at up to date with vitamins/supplements (ashwaganda has helped me a TON). it will be difficult to do any of these things, hell its hard to even eat or keep ourself clean. obviously this wont magically heal you but it can be a huge step. the most important thing is to take care of yourself as much as you can. it may not feel like it but i promise you that youre doing better each day, dont let anyone let you think otherwise. take a breath. sorry for the long paragraph but wanted to help as much as i can. have a nice day and i hope you do well on your interview."

        "body": "I’m not complaining at all about this, it’s just been a general curiosity of mine. I’ve never been able to explain emotion “normally.” I just can’t understand how to. I’ve been told the way I describe emotions are good for writing, or hit close to home. Here is my most recent and I think most important example of this.\n\nMy life has been going pretty well, and my partner has been going through some issues. I am extremely proud of them for starting to talk to their family about it, and, in an attempt to sympathize and urge them to continue, I wanted to explain how I feel after I talk about things. Like how I feel such immense relief after finally getting something off my chest. So, I told my partner the following:\n\nThe people I talk to, friends, family, my therapist, sort it through, take all the dirty clothes out of my overflowing hamper and started sorting them out and helping me get ready to wash them. And therapy has slowly, slowly helped me wash the clothes. It’s like it points out the stains, we work through where it came from and how to avoid spills, and what we’re going to use to start washing. A soft detergent, soft wash, cold water… You’re detangling strings, really. Like when I text my partner I’m feeling accomplished after therapy, I really do. We loosen up the knot and make it easier to see, not just a giant clump of mrobselp and we unscramble the letters into something that makes sense.\n\nIs this “normal” per se, or rather, a healthy way of doing so? I’m not sure if I’m the best at explanations, but I feel at peace in a way.",

        "body": "I would say, the inner psychological world is as real, if not more real, than the physical world. But it is mostly invisible for those who cannot see. Complex emotions, impressions, and inner workings are difficult to describe with normal everyday words. Using metaphors is a way to organize thoughts, to understand yourself, to process it, to put everything in context, and do communicate with whoever.\n\nI believe that's why artists are associated with mental illness. They make impactful art because when you're in the depths of mental hell, and no one listens, no one hears, no one understands, and the loneliness is intolerable, you translate your experiences to stories, paintings, metaphors...  Not being understood can feel like suffocating, like you're hitting a wall in every direction you go, feeling observed by empty dull judgemental eyes, and you need to get it out before you lose your mind. And you try to write something, to create something, something that is an authentic expression of your experience. For me, it's not about real people understanding me but a projection of the people around me. Judgemental empty hollow eyes that put pressure on me but don't see me. By doing art, I assert my expressions against their impressions. \"Good\" art is when it cracks these stubborn walls of dullness. When you show it and they cannot look away, cannot deny, cannot compensate, cannot rephrase. It is good art when the expression is so clear and impactful that it causes nausea, existential dread, and feels like a gut punch, but also all of it is true.\n\nOf course we cannot make other people understand it and I'm not sure if we should. But some people who can relate can understand it. But some people cannot, they cannot perceive it, because when emotions call them, they do not answer the phone, you can call all day and night, you don't even know if anyone is home. Maybe I envy such people."

        "body": "Hi all, I was hit by a drunk driver last fall and it was very severe. Thankfully I survived with only a severe leg injury and minor injuries elsewhere. But ever since then especially since I’ve gone back to work and have really seen how I am in social settings I’ve been so depressed. I thought being in the house was bad and I missed social contact but somehow going back to work and realizing nobody really gives two shits about the fact you were seconds away from being gone is just a hard pill to swallow. I understood it in my brain and there’s really no reason for them to care but everyone thinking because I’m back at work and I can walk again I feel like I’m expected to pretend it never happened. I feel alone and I’m in constant pain still in my ankle, my doctor recommended I never run again. I don’t want to walk down the aisle with a limp. It’s just such a lonely feeling and I know I have support but I’m so angry all of the time now. I am an extrovert and I talk a good bit, but for some reason ever since I came back from the accident anytime someone says I talk too much or gets irritated with me it hurts my feelings 10x more. I get enraged and irritated hearing conversations or by people I work with over nothing, I could just read a book and ignore them but my brain is almost seeking something to be angry at. I’m sorry this is a long post it’s just led to me occasionally snapping and saying something rude and then extreme guilt follows. My coworker/friend recently got a second DUI and it’s upset me so much because they saw my car after the accident and all of the damage that was done to me/the surgery and rehab I had to do. They looked me in the eye and said they would never do it again but then they called me at 2am AFTER the accident and involved me in the situation. I felt it was so unaware and it makes me feel worthless honestly. Everyone feels bad for this person and it makes me so angry considering if they killed someone nobody would be acting that way. I guess I’m being sensitive but I was called by them when I had to be awake in 2 hours for work to get him leaderships number and I never even got a thank you. There’s just no way I can say anything in that environment without it sounding like I’m making it about myself, just upsetting to see nobody really holding them accountable like it was just a harmless one off. drunk driving is a HUGE problem but it hasn’t felt like anyone around me realizes it but that’s beside the point. I’m also military and I’m sure that’s contributed to the loneliness, I just wish I was home with my family sometimes. Sorry this is so long I have just lost sight on who I am. I have a second chance at life and I’m so lost. I feel like my biggest personality traits are the most irritating and as much as I’m trying to change them the anger/irritability is just taking over. I am in therapy and that is helping but it’s only one time every 2 weeks so it just doesn’t feel like enough. Any advice/opinion is helpful thank you",

I know that might not mean much but I really understand what you're going through. The truth is, the vast majority of people are so caught up in their own existence and their own lives that they are oblivious to those around them and what they could be going through. That's why friends and loved ones are so important. In the meantime between seeing friends and family, I would recommend reading books on the subject or listening to podcasts. Whenever I have a problem I often find that the most satisfying and productive way to overcome that difficulty is to ask questions, learn about whatever it is my questions are on, and answer them. There are books on everything. If anger issues are what you are curious about, I am sure there is a plethora of very insightful podcast episodes or books on the subject. The great thing about this is that it doesn't have to end with anger issues. Anything you're struggling with others have had similar if not identical experiences in the past. I find it very comforting that with the internet we can learn about and really tackle most of our problems in the modern age. Information and knowledge really are some of the most powerful tools in life. I wish you all the best, and know that I am rooting for you.

Your anger is justified considering what you went through..One idiot drunk drove and now you are picking up the pieces and dealing with pain everyday. That is a tough pill to swallow.  Sometimes what you are missing is someone to talk to and be in your corner.  Your accident is something you can't change but you can change the narrative. The accident can be a game changer for you. You are in the middle of transition between an old identity and a new you.  Maybe it's time to hang out with people that grow you. I met alot of inspiring people in my life. A wrestler who lost his leg and he never blames anyone and still has bad days. It totally sucks being in pain and working. And some days you just don't want to get out of bed and deal with the world. The world does need people like you but you haven't met the people who lives you can change. Well there are also veterans who lost limbs. Some in the UK managed to buddy together to do off road driving and they fixed up the vehicle so that they can do it.  Maybe find something that could distract you and gives you joy . I would read this book called miracle morning by Hal Elrod.  Emotions either drive you or you drive it no in between.  Alot of us want you to live your best life and whatever makes you happy.  Always remember this. Even when you feel no one is in your corner.  Well they are people rooting for you. You are just in a bad season is all.  We celebrate your wins we cry when you hurt and push you when you need to move into gear.  We believe in you."

I had really bad trauma after surviving a house break-in with my husband where we were tied up, they robbed us blind and it was the most petrifying and horrific night of my life as i feared we were going to be killed or I was going to be raped.  I had really bad PTSD from it, got insomnia which I never had before and was gripped in anxiety/panic attacks 24/7 for approx 6months straight.  I'm the type to pretend everything is okay, which is the opposite what I'm doing now just letting it out to strangers on the internet.  Only my husband knew, but he couldn't even grasp the fullness of it and on top he had his own trauma from the break-in.

        "body": "Last summer there were a couple of months where I think I hit a breaking point from stress and my emotions just turned off for 2 months straight. I couldn't feel joy, sadness, arousal, or interest in anything, and quite honestly I thought I was going crazy. It wasn't until I tried shrooms that I realized that I wasn't completely broken inside and that I could access my emotions. Ever since then, I've been slowly getting back to normal, and while it hasn't been an easy path, I feel like I have made progress. However, I don't feel \"normal.\" At least compared to who I used to be. I'm going to college but commute from home and I am not very involved apart from playing soccer, going to classes, and having some friends there. The thing is, I don't have any interest in getting involved. I've become much more introverted and less competitive. I feel like a completely different person and I don't know why. Am I just changing as I get older or is this something to be concerned about? Day to day I'm pretty happy I have interests and I am learning new things as well as having a great relationship with my family. I do feel like I could be more involved in college, after all, most people say its the best time of their lives, but I just don't feel like I'll derive any innate satisfaction in doing so. I guess I'm \"doing me,\" but again I don't know if I should be concerned about this. I'm 19M turning 20 in a couple of months for reference of my age. If anyone could provide some insight that'd be greatly appreciated. Also this is pretty random but if this helps with anything - my libido has been extremely low and I don't know if this is a sign of something bad.",

        "body": "Hi there, please don't think I'm invalidating any of your feelings but I think what you're feeling is just a normal part growing up, especially at 19.  Young adulthood is hard, you're not a teen anymore yet not an adult, you're trying to find your way and identity and place in this world.  It's normal to change, to go from being an extrovert to introvert and for hobbies and interests to change, this will happen throughout your life.  The person I was at 19 is a totally different person than me now.  Why I think it's most likely that you're growing up is because day to day you're doing good and in your own words feel happy, you're just feeling like you need to do more and have a wider variety of interests/hobbies and that is normal.  Heck I'm 42 and feel like I need to do more in life.  If it really bothers you, perhaps just consult a psychologist to have yourself evaluated and perhaps they could just help with giving you some clear goals to feel more at peace with what you're doing with life.  Good luck!"

        "body": "I was in the same place as you. It might sound contrarian, but I would recommend doing the exact opposite of what your mind is shouting at you. Your mind is shouting telling you that \"you need to get up, you need to fix this, you need to go to the gym, you need to fix your life!\" But that is the exact reason why you are stressing out in the first place. It's because your inner dialogue is pressuring you and stressing you out to change. While I agree that if you want to get better you're going to have to change, I would start by doing what your *body* is telling you to do, which is to rest. Thankfully the weekend is coming up. Just take this weekend and say to yourself, \"fuck that, I'm going to do the opposite of what I'm stressing about and just rest\" and see what happens. Sometimes allowing yourself to take time off and do the very thing that you are so desperately trying to avoid can shift your perspective and give you exactly the time you need to get better. It's all about balance. Stay in there, you got this :)"

        "body": "It's human nature to try to figure out things. That's what gives our brain stimulation. So, therefore, it's natural that our brain will try and figure out the meaning of life and why we're here. The truth is, it's an impossible question to answer, at least as of now. What we do know, is that we are born, and we die. We know what happens in between those two events, but we do not know what happens after or before. Therefore, the possibilities are endless. No one can definitively say there is a God in the same way that no one can say there isn't. What I like to do is try and figure out the things we do know. I look to space as my religion. If there really are any answers that we can hope to get from this whole game called life, it's out there. That at least gives me something to look forward to. A sort of potential answer in all this madness. I have hope that there is something out there. What that may be, I don't know, but imagine there is an advanced alien civilization that has already found the meaning of life out, and all we have to do is meet them and have them tell it to us. Meaning is subjective, and therefore there can be many different perspectives on \"the meaning of life.\" The whole idea that there is a meaning to life at all is just someone's perspective -- someone's opinion. No one ever told us that there has to be a meaning to life. There very well could not be. It's all about perspective and opinions. Who definitively made up the idea that life has meaning to begin with, anyway?"

My parents are against the relationship because we are from different religions but they can't directly ask me to break up as they don't want to hurt my feelings. I feel guilty as they want to accept him but cannot due to the difference. On the other hand they wanted to meet him but not as a boyfriend but as a friend from the sidelines so I had to lie a lot to him that my parents doesn't know about my relationship. This might look simple but previously I had told him my parents knew. Later because they wanted to meet him I had to lie that what I told him was wrong but I was honest about the religious matters. This was 5 months ago. Now a few days ago I could not take it anymore so I told him everything and prepared mentally if he ever told me tat he wanted to break up. Yeah I was prepared till that extent. But even after telling him everything, even after he was hurt in the worst way possible, he wanted to believe me, he wants to continue and tackle all the problems together. I feel like the worst person to have ever existed. I broke his trust more than twice, when all I was afraid of was to be misunderstood I the past when I did nothing wrong (cuz it always costed my friends but back then I never did anything). Now we might be back to normal but the feeling of guilt is eating me up. I am happy with him but at the same time i feel like a loser. I love him but I want to go somewhere far way, from everyone and contact then from time to time, I don't want to face anyone. But I know I can handle everything with him. He is suffering but not telling me so that I don't get hurt. I hate the feeling of hurting him. And today suddenly I wated to lose memories when I almost hit my head. Is there something wrong with me? Sorry for babbling so much but please answer.",

Not to toot my own horn but the qualities are fairly matched between us until it comes to my lying.

I really want to match her level of honesty regardless what the topic is but this weird deep habit keeps holding me back. The balance of telling big truths on my own accord shows me how much better it is and feels to tell the truth, but it seems I need more than that to improve.\n\nI’m seeking professional help as I write this but also want the help and advice from redditors, and how you may have overcome a similar experience.",

Everything happens as it should, and there's nothing wrong with you. You may not know it, but your body is subconsciously signaling to you what it wants, you just have to listen. If getting closer to Christ gives you satisfaction then by all means explore that and walk down that road. Your brain is giving you feedback all the time, you just have to listen. If you don't get pleasure or satisfaction from listening to music anymore I have a great piece of advice for you: stop listening to the damn music. A lack of an emotional response to something is just as meaningful as getting an emotional response from something. I have felt the same exact way as you, and sometimes I still do. One of the most helpful things I have come across is to lean in to how I am feeling. Stop acting on how \"you're supposed to act\" and start acting with how you really feel. Sure, it may not seem normal at the moment, but once you realize that this really is right way forward, it get's so much simpler and easier to walk the path.  \n\n\nRemember: The obstacle is the way."

You are still in your 20s there is still time to find yourself, find the little things that make you happy and surround yourself with those that can help you heal. Saying from experience that it can get better but you need to do the work too. I know it's hard but you have to stop sabotaging yourself like you said. Take it one step at a time, maybe give your mom a chance again? Try to talk to a friend? You are not alone in this. And feel free to reach out anytime!"

        "body": "For a long time now, I've been having issues with waking up. I'm a university student and pretty much every day I need to be up and going at 6 am. No matter how many alarms I set up, I always end up going back to sleep. And when I do wake up, I have troubles with derealization and just existential thoughts in general. I do struggle with that in other parts of the day as well, but in the morning it's the most noticeable and annoying - also, throughout most of the day I'm cheerful and \"normal\" (I even have thoughts of loving my life), maybe a little tired, though.\n\nI'd like to add that this happens no matter how long I sleep. Usually I eventually force myself to get up to class (which makes me feel even worse), but when I have no restrictions, I end up sleeping 10-12 hours. Also, I take very long naps throughout the day to add to that, especially when I didn't get to sleep my \"usual\" 10-12 hours.\n\nI used to take antidepressants but stopped because I couldn't remember to take them. I do regret that. Alarms never help me, I just turn them off and forget what I was going to do. I don't even know if antidepressants could help me with this particular problem. \n\nDo you guys have any tips on waking up on a good note? And waking up in general without having to set up multiple alarms that I'll end up turning off anyways? ",

While the fourth, he just kinda well said think about what you want and it would happen…. \n\nI feel like I never was listened to by any of them because my mom had their ear. And my mom, let’s just say has the emotional intelligence of a rock sometimes. If she think she knows what’s going on, that’s it. Didn’t matter if I said she was wrong. So I never talked to them about my issues.\n\nI just don’t feel much of anything. I never would have said it before with them, but now I feel like every emotion is fake. Like I don’t feel happy, sad, angry, or suprised. I know right from wrong, and I do feel guilt. That’s my only real emotion right now. Every time I do anything that’s the only emotion now, guilt. \n\nI feel like my interests as well have become less fun. Or maybe looking back, they became not interests but ways to pass the time the most tolerably. Even now they seem mundane.\n\nI barley talked to others throughout all of school. Especially high school. Just a very quite kid… I was always ducking quite. I wish my parents didn’t just let me be quite, and made me talk more. \n\nI feel like an idiot who has no interest. Can’t even hold a conversation with a gun to my head. Hell, I’m cowering from calling a 5th psychologist. One that I don’t even have to worry about talking with my mother. I feel really dumb. \n\nI know it’s not good to self diagnose, but I wonder if I’m autistic. I match the DSM5 description. Again I might be wrong. But I just want something to explain why I’m like this. And if I don’t have an explanation, at least help from the new psychiatrist. \n\nAnyways I don’t know what else I want to get off my chest but yeah. \n",

If you've taken a medication multiple times and it didn't work, REFUSE to take it again.  So many psyche doctors love to think they know everything. They don't. A lot of it is guess work on their part. You know you better than anyone. Be progressive in your own treatment and come to your psyche doctor with suggestions you think might work. It took me 30 years to realize this, and it lead me to Ketamine treatment because I had \"Treatment Resistant Depression\" among others like PTSD or Agoraphobia. Point is, you're going to keep being disappointed until you take part in your own mental health. Is it a lot of research and realizing that you can't rely on a \"Perfect\" answer? YES. Is it soul breaking and getting to know yourself? For sure. You'll not only get to know yourself, but the other side of you, you weren't paying attention to. Good luck."

And when your kid talks about it, you just brush it off as something 100% in their control? What about autism and other mental deficits that need external interventions? Not just internal? I’m not saying I am not responsible for my own actions. But you can’t control them if your parents ignore obvious problems that need to be addressed and corrected. Now I’ve worked more on alot of things, but I’m not able to understand everything that others where taught at a young age. The sooner you learn things, which requires external help, you will understand things better. Our brains develop constantly and needs to be taught things by others, or through our own experience. When those who are supposed to raise their kid ignore concerning problems to be corrected, they prevent the brain from properly developing. You can’t expect a kid to pick up a book, eat, or shower if you never teach them too. \n\nI’m now my own person yes, but I feel like all the issues I had and am having problems on still have no answers or solutions. Is it my own fault? Yes it is. But I still keep trying to find out what I’m doing wrong. \n\nI’ve read how to make friends and influence people. Read a book someone sent me, which although helpful, is still not clicking with my brain. And I’ve watched videos and took notes on how to talk with others. Even saw a video series on talking with others if you are autistic… it was helpful. No one diagnosed me as it, and I don’t know if I am. But the video sorta helped with some things. \n\nSorry, I don’t know where that rant came from."

        "body": "I'm just starting antidepressants so I'm trying to figure out if this reaction is \"normal\". I just had a friend call and say I hurt her feelings. My feelings were also hurt and I explained. I couldn't bring myself to apologize for hurting her feelings because the last year and a half I have poured heavily into the friendship with little in return from her. I explained how I feel like the weight of all my friendships is on my shoulders and it is very tiring. At the end, she kind of wrote my feelings off saying \"being depressed makes things seem worse\" which isn't wrong but feels quite toxic. \n\nAnyways, normally after a friend fight like this I am distraught for days and physically stressed out. Tonight though, I feel relatively at peace with the whole situation. For non-depressed people, is it normal to be able to sleep peacefully after getting into a fight with a friend?\n\nI am a little confused by how little ranting I required to move on. It could help that I don't have to see her anytime soon since we have been long distance friends for a few months now. If it is the fact that this is what not being depressed is like, I am mad at myself for not getting medicated sooner.\n\nAlso... side note... I think I might type up an AITA post on this situation tomorrow because I am genuinely curious.",

It can be scary to overcome anxiety obviously but in the long run, it will help you through life. And it will help A LOT. \n\nIf you run this errand with him, instead of ranting to your boyfriend, try going to him afterwards and saying something like \"hey omg, I was really anxious because I know *name* is a really nice man but I felt kinda unsafe being alone with someone I don't know too well/ trust as much and now that I've done it, I feel much more capable and proud of myself.\" And if you find yourself still stressed even tho you overcame something that's major for you, let him know that although you managed it so well, you're still not feeling your best. \n\nThis is letting him know of your anxieties without angering him all the while taking a step towards bettering yourself and your mental health. \n\nBut please, at another time, do talk to him about his anger issues and urge him to get help.

        "body": "One might hear that, and believe it was when I called the child protection services, or all those times I had stood up to the bullies twice my size.\n\n\nBut, the bravest thing I had ever done, was when it was four am in the morning, four hours after I had taken one too many pills, and messaged my older Sister. I didnt want help or to be saved, but I pushed that aside. \n\n\nShe replied straight away, reassuring me I was going to be okay. Shes in Queensland, so there wasnt much she could do, which is somewhat part of the reason why I messaged her, incase she was angry. But also because she's very kind and understanding. You can talk to her about anything, and she gives the best advice. \n\n\nI dont think I'd be here if I hadn't messaged her.\n\n\nAt the time, I was vommiting, dizzy, and severly overstimulated. My dad who was awake at four am as usual for work, heard me vomiting. He knew something was up. I was too scared to tell him, so my sister helped me get the courage to go wake up my mother, and tell her what happened. \n\n\nI dont think I'll ever forget the look of shock and hurt on her face. \n\n\nMy mother told my Dad what happened, and he didnt really say much but he was worried. I was so relieved when I saw neither of them were angry. After she informed my dad, she rang the posion information centre. They told her to bring me to the hospital, so she did.\n\n\nThey told my sibling whos a year younger then me what had happened while I was in the car waiting. I made sure to bring my toy who I got when I was one years old. I've just turned fifteen, and he hasnt left my side since. \n\n\nWhen we got to the hospital, it wasnt long until we were out of the waiting room and in a room being asked what happened. Then we were moved to a smaller waiting room with beds with curtains in between them, and I remember someone crying. Eventually a nurse came to us, and I was put on a wheelchair. \n\n\nThen we were moved to this room with big machines. Awhile after that I was moved to another bed in the emergency room, with fewer machines that you usually see in a hospital room. \n\n\nI remember sitting there, embarrassed of what I had done. Especially when a group of training nurses came along and looked at the machine. They all looked at me sadly when they were informed I was here due to an overdose. I've never felt more gulit then I did that day. \n\n\nI was kept in the emergency room for awhile, because the nurses wanted to keep an eye on me. I had to wear this thing in my nose, incase I stopped breathing during my sleep which felt awfully uncomfortable. Another thing that was bothering me at the time was that needle they stick in your vein. It hurt, and it annoyed the hell out of me. \n\n\nMy dad and mom were with me but soon my dad went home to stay with my sibling. When we moved out of the emergency room to another area, I was put in a bed with the nurses desk to my right. When I saw my heartrate calmed down, I was excited that I might finally get to move to an actual room, but once my mom asked me to stand up, my heartrate went back up as she predicted. I blamed her for being why we didnt get to move to another room, but looking back on it I realise she did the right thing. \n\n\nThen, one of the nurses explained what symbols and numbers meant. She didn't care I had so many questions, and I think she found joy in explaining it to me. Im grateful she was so kind. It wasnt until nighttime I was moved to a proper room, and the next day at lunchtime I was allowed home. I remember taxis waiting outside of the hospital for people, and ours being really nice. He even giving us a free ride. \n\n\nMy sibling and dad was very glad I was home. I think my sibling was sad I had used their medication for adhd which is a lower dose then mine, but I hope they dont blame themself. My mom now opens my door worriedly at night, and she says its to make sure Im not on electronics, but I think she actually does it because she worries Ive overdosed once more, or no longer breathing. It makes me sad and feel sorry for her though I never say anything so she thinks Im asleep because she cant see me in the dark. Sometimes I get flashbacks of when I overdosed, and it still affects me, but Im relieved to say it doesnt bother me as much anymore.\n\n\nI've always felt quite dull about hobbies and activities, but something sparked in me when the nurse was explaining to me the purpose of the machines. That night is why I want to work with medicine one day, so I can help people like me. And I say this with tears in my eyes, because I hold this dream closely to my heart.\n\n\nSince I was around nine years old, I've been suicidal and hoped I wouldn't make it to fifteen, and the bravest thing Ive ever done, is not letting that dream come true and finding a new dream in the process. \n\n",

        "body": "Most of the time i have this feeling which makes me feel like i cant breath, it starts with my heart and ends at my neck  and it slowly starts to feel like im being choked by this feeling , this feeling makes me want to die but i personally dont want to die, it making me want to vomit everything but when i vomit it hurts so much, and it only  a temporary solution since it only stops for a bit, so I've stopped vomiting because it doesn't help, but i shouldn't feel like this, i have a amazing family and friends, and they need me. But this feeling just makes me want to sleep and not wake up, it makes me want to punish myself for being a terrible daughter and friend. But for some reason i just no longer can stand seeing my own blood. Sometimes i want to end everything but i just cant, because i don't want my family/friends to be affected by it, i just want to disappear but at the same time i don't want to abandon those precious memories, some people describe it as deppression or being suicidal but  i feel like im just cant be any of those things  because if it were i would feel like i would be faking it for attention,  but what is this feeling then, some other people call it panic attacks, but i don't think it is, it just feels so suffocating and i cant rely on anyone or they will stop relying on me, and i just cant risk that happening, i have to be perfect so that they can have someone to rant/vent to, i don't want people to have this confusion im having, the feeling of not being able to rant to anyone , i need to act like im okay but im at my limit, i accidentally told my parents some of my troubles because of a fight i had with them and i cant have that happening again, i need them to think im okay so that they don't have to worry about me and stress about it because they have enough things to be stressed about.  I want them to feel happy even if im not, but this feeling is making me just too tired, im getting very tired and if i become too tired, people will realize it, because if they do they wont rant to me because they will be worried and i just cant have that happen, im just repeating and repeating words but i need to find a solution to this problem. But for me to find a solution i need to know whats causing this problem, i dont think its deppression, anxiety, panic attack, eating disorders even tho some of the symptoms from them are a bit similar to what i feel. So what is this feeling? Its just so confusing, i cant go to the doctor because i dont want my parents to waste money on me and i cant go alone since im a minor. I guess ill just have to wait until it disappears or wait a few years until im a adult.\n\nBye bye for now :0",

        "body": "2024 hasn't exactly been great to me so far. Lost my Grandad and contact with one of my close online friends within the first week. I've got holidays planned in June and July which are the only things I have to look forward to this year that my job isn't letting me get the days off for (I know the fact my friend I'm going on holiday with is also working with me doesn't help.) And going through the grind of getting my drivers license has kinda pushed me to the edge of my sanity. Test got terminated, and my instructor made sure to make me feel like crap for it on the way back home all because I coulda gotten him fired. I'm pretty sure I'm autistic (Not sure, still waiting on getting tested, don't wanna resort to a self diagnosis) so I'm not exactly great at handling being yelled at. So I just stayed quiet with a buncha thoughts spiraling. And it's just all put me in this slump with what I want to do with my life. \n\nI don't really have many dreams or goals or ideals, I just have my weekend job that's getting me by and find some inside enjoyment out of because when I'm doing that, it means I don't have to do anything else. And it's not like it's anything amazing, it's literally just minimum wage retail. I've hit a bunch of dead ends with trying to find a new job because I live next to nowhere with not a lot going on and I can't even drive so that limits me even more. It's just a miserable process to go through and something that just drains my energy and morale every time I try and go through it. And it's gotten me to think that maybe I just don't care enough about my future to put the energy in to what should be these massive life moments. \n\nAnd it's not like this has been a recent thing either. I remember years back whenever I'd get asked countless times, questions like \"What's your dream job?\" or \"Where do you see yourself in 5 to 10 years?\" And I was just never able to answer them. Doing those online surveys that match you up with different jobs, I always second guess myself. The only thing I'm really concerned about life wise is making it through every day with as much sanity and will to live as I can. My only plan is to try and save up as much money as I physically can just in case anything happens. I haven't exactly told anyone about how I feel because I don't know how to really explain it. Not as great with words as I am in text. \n\nI see a lotta posts on here and it's gutwrenching, my heart goes out to all you guys. The most upsetting part about life and how it works is that it's just not for everyone. I mean I'm still willing to have fun and to try and make as many great memories as I can but I just struggle to take my life or my future that seriously otherwise. I am seeing a counselor so there's that. I'm only really writing this as a way to get it off my chest and just genuine curiousity of how people will respond or even how many of them see this. I don't feel good feeling this way, heck I admire people who fight for what they can get out of life but it's just not who I am. \n\nMaybe I'll feel differently in the future, and if I do? Great. But as of right now it's kinda just one of those things where I've just had enough. ",

        "body": "A short introduction, I'm currently 17, female. It has banned 11 years since it happened but part of me still feels as if it was my fault that I lost my own innocence at a young age. \n\nAt 1st grade, I went to this public school, I was a typical shy girl and barely talked to anyone cause I was genuinely scared. One time during break, I was approached by two guys, I didn't register what they said other than \"Come with us.\" I thought that I was gonna be friends with them and we were gonna play games so I followed. \nIt didn't seem weird to me when I followed them to an area without cctv's. I thought we were still playing when they asked me to lift my skirt. Of course, I won't go into detail what happened afterwards but all I can say is that no one virginity was taken from what I can remember. It didn't register what happened to me was bad, yet part of me at that time felt embarrassed to tell it to anyone, especially my parents since I thought they would be disappointed. \nYet, I kept following them whenever they told me to come along with them cause I still thought we were gonna play a game and be friends at that time.\nAfter 1st grade, nothing else happened and after a while, I was switched to a different school. I haven't told anyone other than a friend and my partner. \n\n\nIf it is considered as SA, should I open up about it to my parents and ask for help from them? Sorry for any grammar mistakes, I'm not that good in English\n\nEdit 1: Hii! Just for clarification after the \"lift my skirt\" part. They did touch me multiple times and licked me once down there before. They showed me how to do a bj and tried to get me do it, I refused. All I knew at that time was \"touching boys down there is gross\" and that the interactions made me uncomfortable. By 2nd grade, one of the boys came up to me and asked \"Didn't we do gross things together?\" and the interactions stopped all together there.",

Their parents are responsible big time for it so…  If they were older than 16y I’d say it’s some kind of manipulative sa.   Bear in mind that I’m no expert here. I’d go to a therapist and open up about this they know best how to handle situations like this."

It’s normal for kids to be curious about that, and sometimes show each other their bits.  but the way they kinda of teamed up and lead you somewhere could be a little weird, depending on what else they did. \n\nWhen we were 5 or 6, my cousin asked me to see under my pants.  He didn’t do anything to me, he just wanted to look and show me his.  I felt a little bit weird about it, but I wonder if he did too and that’s why he wanted to know?  And did the courtesy of showing me his too? I personally don’t consider it a bad thing.  We were growing up in repressive Christian households and it’s not like our parents were gonna explain it to us.  But if you feel bad about it and it bothers you to this day, it’s definitely worth exploring in therapy."

I thought it was a sort of joke or quirk but she stuck it out the entire time and finally we will both be back at the same time again this weekend when the clocks change. \n\nThis isn’t amusing and she really doesn’t grasp how disturbing this is to me. She usually went to bed before me but now it is an extra hour earlier and sometimes two if she is tired. It means she gets up super early and wakes me up such that I am tired all day. Our meal schedules are messed up except for lunch. \n\nShe wouldn’t let me change the clocks in the cars or in the house. When I asked her why she was in bed at 8:30pm she said “It’s 9:30pm.” No. No, it’s not. Like I said, this was cute for about a week but she has lived like this for months now. \n\nShe doesn’t work and I told her that the only reason she can even get away with this odd behavior is because she has nowhere to be and doesn’t have to conform. She acknowledges that but said that since she doesn’t work she has the luxury. \n\n We are switching to Daylight Time again this weekend so we will mercifully be on the same schedule again but if she tries this again in the fall I will leave her over it. It’s that upsetting to me. She doesn’t seem to understand that at all. \n\nI really don’t know what to do here. Does she need some kind of help? It’s probably a way for her to maintain some control over her life  but is it really harmless or a symptom of a bigger problem?\n",

        "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just needed to come on here and vent about an experience I'm having that feels so uncontrollable. Around Mid-december of 2023, I noticed I was getting very mild anxiety. My work (operated 4 retail stores) became extremely stressful, and I noticed I started having really bad sleep issues. I would try to go to bed, but kept waking up every 2 hours. Every time I'd wake up, it was almost like a rush of adrenaline that would hit me. I would then spiral into thinking the worst (I have cancer, I'll never be able to sleep, oh my god why am I dying, etc...). I kept having panic attacks to accompany it to where I'd be sobbing to a family member at 7am swearing up and down I was about to die. I kept pushing it at work, but every time I'd go in, my brain felt so foggy and I became irritated very easily. There was a whole week where I became afraid of going to bed because I was afraid of the anxious feelings coming as soon as I wake up. This then started manifesting into all areas of my life. I'd go to the gym and just keep imagining bad things happening to me (me passing out, someone noticing me and going \"are you okay?\"). I felt like I was going insane. Like it feels like I have no control over these thoughts.\n\nI handed in my two weeks at my job because it became so unbearable and the dread of going to my job and interacting with people became crippling. I had such a hard time even going to a grocery store. I remember walking down the ice cream isle and suddenly feeling faint and panicky. I remember grabbing items and then rushing through the checkout lane. After my two weeks was up at work, my stress levels seemed to chill out, yet I still felt slightly anxious. I was able to go out a little more with friends, but I would have random moments where I couldn't hear what anyone was saying because I was spacing out and dissociating heavily.\n\nFast forward to the last week and current day, I started getting intense anxiety again. I kept waking up in my sleep and feeling like there's people talking to me. You know when you're half awake from a dream and you can't really tell what's reality yet? That would keep happening to me. I kept hearing people talking in my head then I'd wake up fully and notice I was just tossing and turning. As for the talking, it was any person that was prevalent on my mind (I've been listening to a lot of blink 182 lately and so it was the band members talking to me... I know... weird lol) but it feels like I can hear people. Is there a term for this? I know it's not reality, but it only happens in that half-awake state.\n\nI scheduled a doc appointment and had it this morning. I got a decent amount of sleep, but when I went and described my symptoms to the doctor, I started having an anxiety attack because I was simply in a room with other people and having to pay hard attention to the conversation. The doctor told me I was having heart palpitations and they gave me some water and let me relax before I left.\n\nI've never been this way. I've had slight anxiety issues in the past, but nothing life altering like this. I'd describe myself as a social butterfly with lots of great friends, but now I just want to spend all of my time alone because I'm afraid of freaking out and having an anxiety attack.\n\nI'm scheduled for blood work for lots of things this week, so I'm hoping there's some correlation.\n\nThank you for reading this far if you have. I genuinely feel so afraid of why my brain is doing this constantly as I have no exact reason for it. Any input or advice or just anything would be amazing. Thanks.",

Today I got into a non physical fight at my workplace and left saying some pretty crazy person things. I did not lose my job but afterwards I felt immense self hatred. This is pretty much the story of my life, times where I feel I can do anything and I’m insanely motivated to do things followed by times where I feel very down about the person I am. Honestly, it’s been helpful to me in a lot of ways and although suicide used to be a very common thought, I’m doing pretty well. This whole thing brings me to my question, what defines mental illness? I’m sure to some doctors they would say I’m bipolar. They said I had adhd and in many aspects of life I can focus fine. Where is the line between sanity and mental illness drawn? It just seems so ambiguous and it seems like mental disorders are human constructs\n",

For context I am  a guy I live with my parents and I'm 20(soon to be 21) I've been struggling with my life. I was raised in a cult(JW) and was abused when I was a kid physically (corporalpunishment by dad and bullying in school),  mentally,  emotionally, and sexually (r*d by my old sister) I tried to k*l myself 2 times and didn't tell anyone but a single ex-friend. I lleft the cult about 3 years ago and started working on my mental health. Everything was getting better. I was happier and had dreams for my future. However, everything is falling apart. I've been unemployed for almost year and a half. I have diabetes, PTSD, very bad anxiety and depression and very bad tremors as well. Some times I can't control my hands and/or body from shaking. I used to cope with my mental healt by drawing but the tremors had made it impossible. I honestly feel scared to get a job because of my anxiety and PTSD. I can barely talk to stranger without having an anxiety attack and most jobs around me are costumer service related. I feel very lonely and haven't had any luck with dating apps. I have no friends. And soon I will have no therapist because my insurance just ran out and I can't afford it because I have no money. I feel lost and the fact that I'm venting about it just makes me feel even worst, I feel like I'm complaining and making excuses about my life when there are people going through worst stuff. I feel really depressed and my meds aren't really working. I feel like giving up. I just wanna cry myself to sleep and never wake up. Every time I try to better my life something happens that makes it worst and I'm honestly just tired of everything. So yeah, I'm lost, and don't know what to do.",

I think you have genuine reasons to feel the way that you do. Yes, other people may have it worse but that doesn’t make what you’re going through any less real. I also have depression and severe anxiety. I know what you mean when you say that you can barely even talk to people. I’m the same way. I try not to leave the house unless I have to. Are you in the US or another country? I can’t believe your insurance is just dropping you like that when you obviously need help and support. I’m in the US and have Obamacare and I’m worried that they’ll one day take that away from all of us who depend on it. Have you had any success with any medications? Have you asked your doctor about maybe trying something new that might help? Sometimes it takes trying several meds before you find something that works. Have you given up on faith all together after leaving JW? Whatever happens don’t give up on yourself. Continue fighting the negativity until you see something good come out of it. I truly hope that you get through this and start feeling better."

There was a chapter on ‘The Pooh Way’ will illustrates the principle of Wu Wei ‘not forcing’. At the restaurant, I had this awful job wrapping potatoes in tinfoil. I decided I would do this job according to the minimum appropriate level of force and also using ‘therbligs’ which are units of time, space and motion taken from industrial psychology (I recommend a deep dive into that term). I immediately was wrapping them faster and in a more relaxed fashion than anyone around me, they tried to copy my technique but they could not keep up. The light bulb went on. I applied this principle of minimum appropriate level of force first to my academics, then my friends, then my romantic life. All these things unfolded naturally. I could go on and on."

        "body": "I’m [25F] someone who tries to always keep my mind busy so I don’t start thinking about the past and spiraling into negative thoughts. However, I find that whenever I have any downtime (no matter how short or long), my mind always turns to a variation of the same fantasy: a situation where I’m forced into a relationship/marriage with a man and then he finds out that I’m scared of and repulsed by sex because I’ve been assaulted, and he gets mad at my attackers for hurting me/life and society for failing me. Then, he’ll comfort me, and not get upset when I panic at him trying to give me a hug or give another comforting touch, and he tells me that he will always love me even if I never want to have sex. It’s not a specific man or anything, there aren’t any characteristics/details I assign to this fantasy. \n\nIn addition to always fantasizing about these things when I have downtime, it’s my main coping mechanism for when I have bad flashbacks to one of my assaults. I immediately just imagine myself being held and comforted by some vague concept of a loving man and I feel better. \n\nI’m no psychologist, but I have tried to reflect on why I’m so fixated on these fantasies. I think it must be because I’ve never known a man (other than my father and grandfathers) who was ever interested in me for anything other than sex. After years of being SA’d, I hate any sort of sexual contact, and the entire sensation makes me nauseous. And I feel that there’s no way a man will ever love me if I don’t offer him sex (I feel like I’m expected to “pay” with my body in order to get any amount of male attention), and my biggest dream/wish is to be with someone who loves me for who I am, not my body. So that’s why the fantasy always starts out with an arranged relationship-no man would love me if they had any control over the situation. \n\nRegardless, these fantasies consume my thoughts for hours and hours a day every day, but I can’t seem to think about anything else when I have a moment to myself. I’m sure it’s normal to wish you had someone who loved and supported you, but I don’t think it’s normal to fantasize about it literally 24/7. Does anyone have any ideas as to why I constantly daydream about this and how to get myself to think about something else instead? Or if this is a sign of some other mental illness? I recently started EMDR for trauma, for context. ",

You have had some horrible experiences. \n\nI am not a psychologist, but it sounds like this is a place you are comfortable, that fulfills a need for you. That's probably why your brain keeps going back there even if you don't want to explicitly do so.\n\nIs it a problem for you? Does it hinder you in life? I would suggest seeking talking therapy or CBT. Additionally some antidepressants could help you, especially if they are suitable to treat anxiety and OCD. \n\nGood luck with everything.  I really hope things improve for you."

Most are on a substance abuse (SA) track but some are on a mental health (MH) track. \n\nWe require our clients to attend meetings, but some of our MH clients have no addiction history. We started implementing worksheets for them instead, but that means they don't get to go out and socialize as much as the SA clients. \n\nI've tried to find in person support groups for our MH clients but I am only finding online meetings which may not be feasible since not all clients have access to technology that'll support the online groups. Any suggestions? We have houses in Mercer and South Middlesex Counties, NJ. I feel most of our MH clients are female with depression, bipolar, and borderline personality disorder diagnoses. TIA ❤️",

I know what loss and trauma feels like and know in the moment everything feels so dark and hopeless.  How I coped was to allow myself to feel it all, but put an expiry on those feelings - so I would tell myself today I am going to be angry, sad, depressed whatever feelings were there but tomorrow I am going to wake up and do this and that whatever needs to be done.  That helped a lot because it allowed me to express and feel everything but also not to linger in that negative feelings for too long.  Just take it day by day, perhaps start a gratitude journal and write just one thing you are grateful for-for that day.  It can be really simple like the taste of that first cuppa coffee in the morning, waking up with the sun shining and how good that feels on your skin (whatever it may be for you).  What this does is actually shifts your focus even for a few minutes on something good.  You may not feel it works in the moment but what do you have to lose?  For me personally I look back and see the progress even if it is small.  I hope my advice helps a little x"

        "body": "\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have severe anxiety and OCD. I am 23 in grad school. I have no family history of mental illness besides OCD.\n\nI was recently diagnosed with OCD but I have had the tendencies my entire life and this bad high really brought it out and was even hospitalized for it in the past due to the extreme anxiety (unrelated to this story).\n\nSo, this happened about 3 months ago right after finals I wanted to relax so I got high, I had to pass drug tests for my co-op, so my tolerance was very low, and I took more than I normally do and I was also high alone in my college apartment which is never the case.\n\nI was playing COD with my buddies online. I took way too much edible (120 mg) and this made me very anxious and also took 200 mg of caffeine of reign. So, then I thought I heard something, and I ripped my headphones off, and it sounded like my neighbors/someone in the hallway, but I was so high that it made it sound like it was in my apartment.\n\nThis made me super anxious, because I thought what I was hearing was not real (but in hindight it probably was). Then my friends got off and I stayed on because I was super anxious that I would hear something and I wanted them to stay on because I thought I was going to hallucinate and hear something not real when I took my headphones off. Then when I eventually did take my headphones off I was so tired and anxious.\n\nThis led to me hearing what sounded like intelligible conversation(I also had a ton of white noise in my room) and this made me freak out into a panic attack, because I thought I was in psychosis. I had no delusions, messages, or anything from what I thought I heard.  My tinnitus was so bad (always is when I am high) that I couldn't tell where I was coming from but it sounded like white noise in my apartment. I went to sleep and felt completely normal the next day until I googled schizophrenia symptoms and now, I am very anxious about getting it.\n\n\nThis has made grad school near impossible this semester and I am struggling under the stress of school and this stupid crap I should have never done.\n\nSorry, that is a lot, but I do not think like that anymore. Do I have any reasons to be concerned at all?? Is this normal? I am sorry, I just wish I never got high, and I am scared I screwed up my mind and my career. Yes, I am **NOT** getting high EVER again.\n\nOnce again, my pcp, psych, and 2 therapists are **NOT concerned but I am**. This anxiety has been extreme because I am so scared of schizophrenia.\n\n**My psych said this:**\n\nHe was extremely confident that I didn’t experience psychosis and that my anxiety was making me hear stuff because I was anxious about hearing stuff.\n\nHe said audio distortions can happen with extreme anxiety and combine that with the psychoactive ingredients in thc it caused me to freak out.  \n\nHe also said in 25 years hes been a psychiatrist he has seen psychosis and people with “nondecript” symptoms that I have experienced.  He said he has never had someone develop a psychotic disorder with nondescript symptoms that I had experienced.",

So he helped me by teaching me through IFS, where I was able to pretty much self assess to \"A scary degree of accuracy\". He actually recommended I look into becoming a therapist myself funny enough, but more on topic he said the best way of coping was to be aware how often I was actually in self and try to maximize that, though I've found that occurs almost never for me."

However my question is; how do you feel when you’re unmasked by yourself with your emotions? *( if the answer is very much different, I’d say start with processing how it could be impactful for you; meaning changing, a different approach of routine/step.) Do you have support that can be there during so? If this does feel like an impact on your life, it’s okay to slow down and know you’re safe even in the change."

So I don't really \"Know how\" to regulate it beyond fleeting moments of slight enjoyment or disappointment usually with mask on. It's hard to describe, but I mean for the most part when I \"unmask\" I'm just empty, and very rarely I actually can tap into that exile/self, though more commonly the exile(As in reality exile and self are just two sides of the same coin)."

If comfortable I’d say try to find the emotions you don’t know if/how you feel them and then see where the emptiness fits in? So if you like movies, books, even pictures with great imagery, even observing them too. Use that to match the emotion with the feeling. Just self care afterwards as well it’s good for the brain helps it stay focused and rewarded."

I hate what I’ve become, and I hate myself for making me this way. I wanna go back to being able to tell my mom i love her without it feeling weird or forced. I’m alone, i hate being alone, but I’m doing it to myself. Why am i this way? Why can’t i be normal. I wanna be normal. I come across as someone who has their life put together. Deep inside my mind is full of horrible things. Lust, hate, anger. I’m drowning in a sea of my own mistakes. I wish someone would hold my hand, but i push away those who offer. Am I gonna be this way forever? Why can’t i find peace? What did i do to deserve this? All these questions i ask myself, but i know the answer. It’s because of me. I wish i had peace.  Who am i? ",

        "body": "﻿\n\nI don't know if this is the right sub, it might be, but I don't know. But essentially, I can't feel much of anything. I can feel basic things like happiness, sadness, anger, stuff like that. I feel bored a lot too, but that's about it. I don't get surprised, I'm not really afraid of anything so I don't feel fear all that much or get scared, when I do it's very minor, I don't feel awkward ever, I only get excited over very specific things that I already like, and I don't like much. I have hard time really \"loving\" people, I wouldn't even say I love my family that much. I appreciate then for basically keeping me alive when I was little, and I like them, but I don't love them. I don't feel empathy at all, my closest friend could tell me the most horrible and devastating thing and I'd try to comfort them and I'd try to pretend like I feel bad but I really don't, I honestly do not care, I feel nothing twords them because it's not my problem (and even if it was, I doubt I'd feel much of anything even then). I don't really care much about other people, of course I like my friends and I like my family, but if anything happened to them I don't think I'd care. Maybe that's just because I haven't experienced then actually dying yet, but when my best friend got in an almost fatal car crash years back, I felt nothing, I didn't care, I wasn't worried at all, I just sort of moved on. Whenever people try to give me advice, I don't care, when people share their interests or hobbies, I don't care unless they're the same or similar to mine. \n\nI understand that everyone else feels thing's that I don't, and I understand those things they feel by definition obviously, but I don't understand how they feel because I don't feel them. I don't really feel bad that I don't feel them and I don't feel like I'm missing something because I never experienced them in the first place so there's nothing to miss, I really just want to know why. If you can answer, that'd be cool, thanks.",

I had 2 people who did though, one was a close friend of my mom and the family, she'd tell me she loved me and hug me, tell me I was handsome and stuff but she moved to another country when I was young, prob before 5. \n\nThen my aunt, it wasn't as much as my mom's friends, who was basically an aunt for me. But she would still hug me and such or comfort me when I was sad but she died when I was in highschool. \n\nI feel like the few people who showed me love and affection one way another left me pretty soon and I lived most of my life not feeling loved or watching others, like my friends being loved by their parents and wishing I was them. \n\nLike hell, I remember in elementary school wishing my mom would love me like my friend's mom loved them. \n\nThen in highschool I was bullied, it didn't feel like being bullied because I was also making fun of myself, my appearance and my personality cause that was what my friends did and that's how I could fit in but it destroyed my self esteem. \n\nNow I'm in my mid 20s, I tell my mom I love her and she does too but it just feels like nothing, I see couples walking together, holding hands and I feel a pain in my chest. \n\nI fucking try to cope using roleplay audios, basically listening to someone roleplaying loving me, being my gf, falling in love with me or just caring about me. It fucking hurts so much sometimes that it makes me cry. \n\nI've just been feeling so unwanted, so unloved, so unimportant my whole fucking life. \n\nMan I remember being in fucking elementary school and hugging the towels before taking a bad thinking someone was hugging me too. It's fucking pathetic and miserable, a poor kid having to resort to that because everyone who loved him was gone. \n\nI'd give my fucking life away just to feel loved once again, just a fucking hour of feeling like someone cares then fucking kill me, I don't care. \n\nI'm tired of life, I'm tired of everything, I just want to feel loved or fucking disappear forever.",

Sorry if this does not make a lot of sense l'm delirious and have not slept.\n\nSo my sleeping problems started about two weeks ago and I just had problems falling and staying asleep and it got worse and worse as the week has gone by, I was sleeping less and wake up more and more. And we are here today where I have not slept in around 30ish hours except for like one hour then I woke up and could not go back to sleep.\n\nI also stated my period about two days ago and it the heaviest period of my entire life, yesterday I bled through like 6 ultra tampons and it still was coming today was just as bad and I have had the most painful cramps of my life. \n\nI have also been really cold recently and have had super bad headaches and sometimes I feel like I’m going to pass out ( I was in a lab class for four hours yesterday walking around and standing up I felt fait and lost my balance but one of my classmates helped me stay on my feet but i did not pass out or anything) \n\nThat’s all I can think of at the moment I have tried every sleep aid over the last two week and nothing has worked. If you have any suggestions please comment them or if you need more information ask away I will probably still be up to answer questions.\n",

        "body": "I (24F) had a very traumatic childhood. When I was in fourth grade, my father cheated on my mother with our helper. I witnessed my parents fighting for several years—physically, emotionally, and financially. I saw my mother being abused. As the eldest, I kept my composure and acted as if nothing was wrong, but I constantly suggested leaving the house. I was known to be resilient. However, this affected my relationships with others, and I easily cut off friends. It also affected my self-confidence, and I became timid and shy. I remember during my younger years, before all hell broke loose, I was a happy kid, always laughing and active in school. Despite everything, I diligently attended school and achieved honor rolls, but I was that student who always hid, afraid to raise her hand even though I knew the correct answer. College years came, and I still did my best as a student. I met a guy who cheated on me during my most vulnerable time. I never expected him to do such a thing, yet I moved on.\r  \n\r  \nNow, I have met my first-ever boyfriend. I feel like all of the emotions and grudges are slowly resurfacing. I feel bad that he experiences my outbursts. I become anxious when he has his alone time. He is also going through a midlife crisis, and I don't want to add to his burdens. I experience anxiety, having the biggest meltdown where my whole body trembles, and my hands and feet go numb to the point where I can no longer control them. Lately, I have been feeling extremely down; emotional pain feels like physical pain. I get scared when I start hurting myself, as it seems to lessen the internal pain. Every day, I think about ending my life, which is the last thing I want to do. I still want my mother to have a better life, as she has suffered a lot, but the pain I am feeling is unbearable.\r  \n\r  \nI am planning on moving out before seeking help. My family is very traditional, and they would make a big deal about it if they found out. There is no nearby help, and I would need to travel for hours. In terms of online consultation, I feel like I would cry the moment I open up, and I do not want that. My eyes swell easily, and I don't want anyone to know. I have been feeling so down and alone lately that I no longer want this life.",

I thought that the boys who cut in line at my school were annoying pos. I thought about murder. I never acted on them, but my brain still goes \"what if you did?\" I thought mostly about murder, but I rarely though about sexual assault. Usually it would just be \"I hope they get r-\" for a few seconds before chilling out. But a small amount of times, for a small amount of time my brain thought about it. I'd never do it. But I'm afraid that I could've done it for a second if I was like that for long enough. In my mind, I wouldn't do it for more than a a few seconds before stopping, but still. How do I stop feeling so guilty? Am I a bad person? I cry when people yell at me, and feel guilty for way less. But still... I wish my school counselor was here today so I could talk to her about it. I've always considered it one of the most evil crimes. While I was thinking those things, I was only really bothered by the thoughts of SA. I guess back then my brain just tried to come up with the worst thing because I got angry so easily. I think these thoughts may be because I was exposed to porn at a young age aswell.",

If you perceive it as good and just another chapter your life has for you, you will feel it’s good and you will manifest good things.

There's stupid optimism, which says that things are great when they're obviously not, but there's also smart optimism, which is always looking for ways to make lemonade out of the lemons life gives us every day - big ones and little ones. Instead of cursing your bad luck when things don't go as planned, look for the advantages of the new situation. Use your imagination. This is how to be \"lucky.\"\n\nVery often, if we can't change a situation we can change our view of it. A therapist can tell you about this. Many people are using philosophy or traditional Asian methods.\n\nAn old book that's becoming more and more popular - The Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.\n\nMindfulness apps like Headspace and Calm are very popular. The most popular is Headspace, which has a free Intro you can use over and over. Mindful Life Project is very good and it's free.\n\nPsychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg, who have published 6 papers on breathing and mental health, recommend a 3-part program of mind-body methods - slow breathing, meditation, and slow body movement such as tai chi exercise, which you can learn with one or two beginner’s videos on YouTube. Incorporate these into your daily life. Be aware of changes in mood and respond mindfully, aware of your breathing. \n\nPeople are often frustrated with meditation. Here’s a simple meditation for beginners. The video tells  you about Brown and Gerbarg’s breathing exercise -\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d9xFfA6F50&t=88s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d9xFfA6F50&t=88s)"

Many years of the same track being on repeat from the moment I woke up, until I went to sleep...and if I was unlucky enough to dream, it'd be there too.\n\nI went through all types of counselling, psych meds, you name it. In the end I had to throw everything out and start again. New living location, dropped my career of 20 years, lost friends and family, completely changed my diet, and the biggest was throwing away every expectation I had of myself....and just live.\n\nI've been through 3 life threatening illnesses (psychosis being one of them) and I finally woke up that ultimately, everything is meaningless. There's a beauty in that because guess what? We're all going to the same place in the end. So why hold onto regret? There is no past, nor future, only now....because you can't change nor dictate the other 2. \n\nWhat I came to terms with is been doing this all my life and no matter what stage I was at, I'd look back and think \"damn, if only I'd done that\". I drove myself insane for over 3 years worrying about shit I'd done, said, hadn't done, hadn't said...for what? Nothing.\n\nFind something, anything to brighten your day. Even if it's small, then build on it. Was today a little better than yesterday? Keep a dairy with feelings, then look for feel good patterns. I found peace in propagating plants. Besides my family, no matter what, it puts a smile on my face.\n\nWhatever you do, don't bury anything with drugs or alcohol. It's like trying to put out a fire with petrol.\n\nWarm wishes and hope you find peace."

I currently have a Bachelors in Women and Gender Studies and am looking for an online masters. I have some health issues so online is best. Ideally I’d love to do full time, but it depends on financial aid/loans I can find. Looking for affordable but quality programs. Bonus is they offer any sort of work study type programs! Thank you!

I’ve also somewhat had those panics because it feels like I’m almost sunk back in my mind and in a movie theater watching my life play out through the eyes of somebody else moving. It’s weird and feels like a trip.\n\nHonestly I can’t name a specific object that causes me to have an intense disassociation moment but there was this one time about a month ago when I was at a friends house and I “zoned in?” Like I remember I was sitting at the kitchen counter starting at the clock on the oven and suddenly it felt like I was swung into a body and gained control and consciousness. I started uncontrollably crying and running outside, rubbing my hands through the grass. I felt insane and idk what it was because I don’t have trauma related to ovens or clocks or anything like that. \n\nThere was also this other time which may be more related to what you’re talking about. About a month or two ago, I was up late at night, about 2-3am because I have sleep issues. I went to the bathroom and when I looked in the mirror it felt like I was looking at a stranger, felt like I was trapped in somebody else’s body. I started having the most intense panic attack I’ve ever had to this day, my knees buckled and I kept looking back and forth at my hands. I eventually was able to get back to my bedroom and I crawled in the blankets and cried, horrified. This attack lasted about an hour, like yours. It was late so everybody in my house was sleeping, and everybody I could text was as well so I was sitting there scared out of my mind because it felt like I wasn’t conscious or I wasn’t in my own body. Fucking horrifying.\n\nI don’t really know how disassociating works but it sucks not feeling in control, but it also helps me be able to escape horrible experiences I still live through daily. I don’t know if what I talked about helped but disassociating is a real thing and I don’t know how to fix it."

You explained it perfectly, feeling sunk back into your own body watching it play out like a movie. \nI start just imagining things and hearing things in my mind that feel like a dream, sayings and experiences that I've never been through, It feels like I'm trying so hard to remember what is happening I have just completely lost grasp, all while in reality when that is going on inside my head I'm normally just walking around, working or sitting down trying to catch my breath\n\nand that zoned in feeling that you're talking about, I 100% understand- I get like that very often whenever I see a fire hydrant or fire extinguisher I have NEVER had any traumas relating to those, but very often I just feel the sudden dread and kind of just sink back into my mind almost, and then this starts that kind of dissociation episode\n\nIt does actually help a little bit hearing someone share their experience with it, It makes me pretty sure that what I've been going through seems to just be something that some people get more intense than others"

        "body": "Anxiety or psychosis?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have severe anxiety and OCD. I am 23 in grad school. I have no family history of mental illness besides OCD.\n\nI was recently diagnosed with OCD but I have had the tendencies my entire life and this bad high really brought it out and was even hospitalized for it in the past due to the extreme anxiety (unrelated to this story).\n\nSo, this happened about 3 months ago right after finals I wanted to relax so I got high, I had to pass drug tests for my co-op, so my tolerance was very low, and I took more than I normally do and I was also high alone in my college apartment which is never the case.\n\nI was playing COD with my buddies online. I took way too much edible (120 mg) and this made me very anxious and also took 200 mg of caffeine of reign. So, then I thought I heard something, and I ripped my headphones off, and it sounded like my neighbors/someone in the hallway, but I was so high that it made it sound like it was in my apartment.\n\nThis made me super anxious, because I thought what I was hearing was not real (but in hindight it probably was). Then my friends got off and I stayed on because I was super anxious that I would hear something and I wanted them to stay on because I thought I was going to hallucinate and hear something not real when I took my headphones off. Then when I eventually did take my headphones off I was so tired and anxious.\n\nThis led to me hearing what sounded like intelligible conversation(I also had a ton of white noise in my room) and this made me freak out into a panic attack, because I thought I was in psychosis. I had no delusions, messages, or anything from what I thought I heard.  My tinnitus was so bad (always is when I am high) that I couldn't tell where I was coming from but it sounded like white noise in my apartment. I went to sleep and felt completely normal the next day until I googled schizophrenia symptoms and now, I am very anxious about getting it.\n\n\nThis has made grad school near impossible this semester and I am struggling under the stress of school and this stupid crap I should have never done.\n\nSorry, that is a lot, but I do not think like that anymore. Do I have any reasons to be concerned at all?? Is this normal? I am sorry, I just wish I never got high, and I am scared I screwed up my mind and my career. Yes, I am **NOT** getting high EVER again.\n\nOnce again, my pcp, psych, and therapist are **NOT concerned but I am**. This anxiety has been extreme because I am so scared of schizophrenia.",

Sometimes crying with the pillow helps too, because it always feels better letting emotion out if the body feels somebody else there. So I would recommend spending some time cuddling something like a pillow or get a stuffed animal you can be close with and fall asleep with. \n\nAlso I would recommend joining a subreddit or two in relation to the new country you’re in, as well as trying to find new groups of people and get help for that place specifically. Reddit is a big place, and I’m sure a lot of people would love to help you find safety, security and support in your new situation. 🫶🫵"

        "body": "I'm a 26-year-old woman who's always had some social anxiety, but I used to be able to manage it and communicate without issues. However, after facing significant trauma last year and losing six close friends, my ability to socialize has drastically decreased. Now, I mainly go to work and then straight home, with little social interaction outside of that. \n\nLately, speaking has become physically difficult for me. It feels like I've lost the natural ability to move my mouth and lips when I talk. It just feels so difficult to be able to physically make those oral motor movements. I'm constantly aware of how my mouth looks when I speak, and producing words feels awkward and forced. This issue seems to be worsening with people I'm not comfortable around, though it varies even with those I am comfortable with.\n\nOn top of this, I've been diagnosed with being on the autism spectrum, OCD (with intrusive thoughts), ADHD, and PTSD within the past year. I was already diagnosed with BPD 2 years ago but I have been in therapy every single week since then and as of right now my triggers and symptoms are manageable. I believe the lack of social interaction, compounded by my recent trauma and diagnoses, has caused a regression in my speech abilities. It's surprising and challenging, especially since I've been relatively high-functioning and was only diagnosed with autism later in life.\n\nNow, I find myself overthinking every aspect of speech, something that seems to come effortlessly to others. At times, it feels nearly impossible.\n\nDoes anyone have advice or has anyone gone through something similar? How do you manage or improve speech and social interaction under these circumstances?",

        "body": "Honestly, something that’s helped me be better at speaking is spending time taking care of myself. I’ve found it slightly easier to say things that may feel uncomfortable, to call somebody out or even just say hello to a stranger. Now loving yourself may sound cliche, and it’s not a cure-all to social anxiety. But when you become more comfortable with yourself and confident in yourself, and realize that you have incredible value as a human being, day-by-day it becomes a little easier to speak.\n\nA way I’ve been able to get myself to speak a little easier is by reflecting on myself and really thinking about what I want as a person. Like for example. I used to not be able to go back up to the counter if a restaurant got my order wrong. Or if my family was yelling at me for something trivial. Once I took the time to realize that I deserve to have the correct order that I placed and spent money on, or that as a person, I don’t deserve to be disrespected by my own family, it helped me become a little more confident and it translated to more words being able to come out. Think of speaking as fighting for yourself, it’s going to be hard, but you have to do it sometimes to love yourself. \n\nNow I’m not saying it’s easy, I’ve had to force myself to talk a lot. I used to have a phobia of phone calls (and I still do somewhat), but the way somebody I was close with told me was that the more I do it, the easier it will get.\n\nSounds a little silly, but for speaking, practice helps a lot. Now I don’t mean try to practice and go over every possible outcome/response to a situation; that’s just going to lead to overthinking and it’s not constructive. Instead, practice physically placing your body in awkward situations, practice moving your feet to walk over to that person you want to and then that will be the baby steps to bigger things like speaking, which is a lot more stressful \n mentally.\n\nEither way, you just gotta love yourself and know that your voice is powerful. You have to use it as a tool to love yourself and I want you to realize that you’re important and your words/opinions have value. You just gotta keep trying to build it gradually, and maybe even take a speech class. Anyway, it won’t happen over night, but I know you’ll get there eventually. 🤞🏽\n\nAlso sorry for the rant lol"

She spent 7 years homeless and pulled herself out of it. We have been together now for over 5 years and her issues have been progressing to the point of ending herself. \nSo posting here is kinda a desperate plee to see if anyone can relate and give tips to help. Therapists kick her out, medication makes it worse and she only has me to lean on, granted that also means I am the one that receives the tears and rage. She said I can't relate, so my positive encouragement is Sean as invalidating . All I want to do is support her better and be the best husband I can be. Sorry for the long post.",

I’ve tried different hairstyles, skincare routines, even makeup and I still don’t feel pretty. Maybe it’s because I haven’t found the right skincare yet or because I don’t know how to use makeup but I just want to feel pretty. And I know I should just accept myself for who I am but it’s impossible when everyone around me is just effortlessly pretty without doing anything for it.

One of the most important life lessons I’ve ever learned is that you have to do things that make you uncomfortable in order to gain what you want. Comfort is nice, but it’s not the point of life. Do you want therapy? Do you truly believe it will help you? There’s lots of evidence that it works, but do YOU want it for yourself? If the answer is yes, it will be worth the discomfort. Being scared is part of life, it won’t kill you. It’s not even a bad thing. It’s another one of the flavors of living. A little bitter helps you appreciate the sweet. Don’t try to *not be scared,* try to *be okay with being scared.* You got this!"

Began losing weight, stopped moving all together and has lost like 50lbs. Then his anxiety worsened to the point where I couldn’t leave him anywhere alone, he can’t go anywhere without me. Doctors checked him for thyroid problems due to weightloss and vitamin deficiencies, all his numbers are fine. They checked his stomach and seen that he has mild gastritis and a small hiatel hernia. He also has a controlled throat condition. His body aches and hurts no matter how much moving he does, on days he does more moving and walking and playing with our kids. He feels even worse the next day. He’s depressed. His anxiety is bad and I’ve been calling to get him seen at a clinic for therapy but no one ever calls me back, he hates my family and they treat him wrong and I’m trying my best to help him.  I feel like I’m losing my mind trying everything, we’ve got two young kids. Idk how else to help, I’ve gotten him in to see all the doctors I can and I’m still trying. But what else do I do now? No one is helping, nothing is being done, we tell the doctor that he still can’t eat enough because his stomach pain and they do nothing.",

Healthline, a reliable source, has an article that rates online services.\n\nThings I often tell people -\n\nYou might want to try a warm line.\n\n https://www.nami.org/NAMI/media/NAMI-Media/BlogImageArchive/2020/NAMI-National-HelpLine-WarmLine-Directory-3-11-20.pdf\n\nAlthough self-help based on CBT has not been shown to be as effective as the standard treatments for anxiety with office visits, some people benefit from it. Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health, a book based on polls of more than 3,000 professionals, says that The Feeling Good Handbook by Dr. David Burns, a psychiatrist and cognitive therapy expert, is the one recommended most often by professionals.\n\nIn recent years, there has been very encouraging evidence for therapeutic breathing, which can be combined with cognitive therapy methods for dealing with worrisome thoughts.\n\nWhen we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.\n\nOne is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min in the early morning and at bedtime is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.\n\nWhen you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.\n\nDon't make mountains out of molehills.\n\nAlso, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.\n\nThe treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.\n\nDon't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.\n\nA good habit - always respond to a stressful moment by breathing slowly. Just a few slow breaths is good."

I'm still in school, and the state provides financial support for students up to a certain age, but only under the condition of regular attendance without any missed lessons. If you skip a few lessons, they will reduce or cut the support and may ask for it back. The issue I'm dealing with is that I can't tolerate my classmates. They always find something to laugh about, and somehow I get dragged into it every time. When someone calls my name, the others laugh. They make slightly racist remarks that they seem to find amusing but i don’t and that little thing bothers me for days, the teachers are constantly expecting me to interact with my classmates as they laugh at me.\n\nYesterday, I received a letter from the school notifying me that they've reduced my financial support. My mother is my only support, and she's ill, so I know things will become even more challenging. I'm failing all my classes, and if I continue like this, I'll have to repeat a year and endure the same situation, not to mention the additional stress it will cause my mom.\n\nMy mother frequently shouts at me, as do my teachers and older siblings. This makes me feel trapped in a never-ending cycle. If I skip classes, I'll lose my financial support and screw up my education. If I attend, I'll be extremely anxious throughout the day, which may lead to me skipping anyway.\n\nI realize that few people find themselves in a similar situation, but besides offering encouragement, is there any advice you could give me?",

        "author": "Worried-Knowledge246",
        "timestamp": "2024-03-07T21:17:19",
        "body": "Some background. My main problems have been - since the age of 5 - OCD, depression, anixety and escapism.\n\nOne of the habits that I have developed as a result is Maladaptive Daydreaming (MD). It's basically daydreams where you imagine scenarios where you are the victor (or at least, you are righteous), even when you know those scenarios wouldn't play out like that in real life. It's a comfort blanket. Everyone does this - some people (me) do this a 24x7, hence we now have a standard term for it - Maladaptive Daydreaming.\n\nMy parents are partially to blame for my current state. Their obsession over my academic performance in high school made my OCD way worse, and made me a nervous, overthinking wreck for life.\n\nThis is where my MD takes dark turns occasionally - I fantasize about venting at my parents, and about letting them know how they are responsible for my poor mental health. In my daydreams, I say mean, hateful things to them - some of which would be justified, others would be not. I dream about taking my life in front of them, just so they would feel some remorse.\n\nI have tried to forgive them and move on with my life for a very long time now. I keep telling myself that they are not blameless, but they are not entirely at fault either. They made some bad choices regarding how to fix my performance at school, which just happened to not play with my mental health, and made everything worse for life. I guess they didn't know any better?\n\nIn my adult life, I have also had a heart-to-heart with them about this - twice, in fact. I feel like there's not much to be gained from saying more to them, except hurting two old people. There's nothing they can do to undo the damage, after all (this is pretty much what they say whenever I have these discussions with them).\n\nBut every few weeks/months, I still keep coming back to fantasies of me venting at them. At other times, my fantasies will find a reason to vent on other people, even when they are nice to me in real life. So it's a bigger problem than just my parents.\n\nI think I do this because in my fantasies, I find a scenario that makes me feel vindicated/righteous. Somehow, it feels like expressing righteous anger at someone - even in a fantasy - makes up for all the years I have had to endure OCD. This is obviously just a safety blanket that does nothing to improve reality.\n\nSo what can I do to stop these fantasies? Here's what I have done so far:\n\n* I have made myself aware of my personal ticks, and the underlying emotional issues that give rise to those ticks.\n* I have also compiled a bunch of reasons for precisely why MD is more harmful to me than good. I try to go over this list in the morning occasionally, to help me avoid MD throughout the day.\n* Every single day, I devote time to bettering myself - and to improve upon the circumstances that made me a habitual daydreamer in the first place.\n\nThere are other things that may contribute to my MD:\n\n* Not having had friends for the last 10 years. MD makes me feel like I can at least imagine talking to someone. I know this is not healthy, but at the moment I don't have the time to make friends. I have to work extra hours just to keep up.\n\nOther things I have tried:\n\n* Seeing a therapist. I have seen several in the past - for several years, and they did nothing to improve my situation.\n* Working out. I do that when I can, at least twice a week. I literally do not have the time to devote more of myself to this at the moment.\n* Eating healthy - I try when my depression lets me.\n* Picking up a hobby - I have already picked up several. But owning to my lack of time, and the OCD/overthinking, it's hard to pursue anything seriously. Besides, ***picking up a hobby is exhausting when you know that you have to struggle 10x as much as anyone else to make progress, because your mental health won't let you focus***.\n\nThese fantasies sometimes creep into my work, and it becomes a problem to get anything done. I can control them sometimes, but not always.\n\nWill I always suffer from Maladaptive Daydreaming?",

        "body": "So i'm a first year college student. I have mental health issues and take medications for them now but before that I really struggled. School was a massive stressor in my life for a long time. It landed me in the hospital one time, that was a huge intervention for me. But I've still been struggling since then in a new way. My therapist explained that it's a trauma response I developed due to years and years of stress and fear while being undiagnosed. I have extreme reactions to very small things related to school because I've convinced myself I'm always going to fail and nothing will ever go right for me. It comes off like I'm lazy or don't care but really I do, it drives me insane. But whenever I try to do the thing  i'm frozen in fear. It could be something as small as checking my email, but it'll send me into an anxiety attack. Obviously this has gotten me into some pretty bad situations. For most of last semester I was doing fantastic, I was so happy and stress free. But near the end I got the flu and fell behind. I didn't do well in one class to end last semester and it actually destroyed me. I was depressed all winter break and ended up returning to campus late. At that same time I was taking new medication for a chronic illness I have and it took a couple weeks to get into my system, so I was having to deal with all the symptoms. One of them is brain fog, like a constant state of being disoriented. During that time I worked myself up so intensely that I began avoiding three of my classes. The idea of going to them made my mind race uncontrollably and threatened to sent me into a panic attack. It snowballed really badly and now I'm in an even worse situation. The fear is almost primal, but not going to classes is destroying me because I actually want to, I just freeze everytime I think about it. I can't take it anymore. I don't want to end up self harming again but I'm so intensely afraid of handling this situation. To make this all worse I have a chronic illness that makes me feel terrible all the time so that's just an added stressor. I actually have disability benefits like assignment extensions because of it but using them makes me embarrassed. My brain paints a picture of me being yelled at and berated by my professors for not showing up. I don't know what to do or say to them. I'm so lost and can't even bring myself to admit it out loud. The stress is so bad it's making my body have a reaction. I feel like the world is ending. Please help me \n",

Stupid of course but it ate away at me. I then began to feel that I didn't want my team to win because it would prove the thoughts were real.\n\nMy feelings towards football were then tainted and within a few days I had gone from passionate fan to feeling very little for the sport or my team.\n\nBut what scares me is that the passion is gone but also the desire to regain that passion. As if I'm just not bothered by the loss. I should be mourning but deep down I'm not and I want it back. But I actually don't. And so on.\n\n I feel like I'd be pretending if I watched football and actually feel a sense of unease at the thought of being a fan again. It's actually off-putting to envisage me having that relationship with football which is baffling.\n\nHas anyone else felt a sudden loss like this and the loss of desire as if it's never been important?\n\nI'm scared at how quickly it can change.\n",

It's good at giving you structured ways of thinking things through to reframe them and consider what cognitive biases could be at play. It kind of feels like meta-ing the bully, like, \"I know you're there, I'm watching you, I understand you.\" If you can't afford therapy there are good self-help workbooks that will go through CBT exercises which are pretty cheap.

In my country, for all air force aircrew and officer roles you have to take a really long exam that lasts all day, and you get your results as soon as you're done. Got mine back today, and nothing is positive. Not only did I not get the role I wanted, I'm not allowed any role listed on the results paper. Just feel so embarrassed, I had so many people cheering me on only for me to absolutely shatter this opportunity. I'm just sitting here on the bus home contemplating life as aircrew is all I wanted, can't see myself doing anything else. Everything else genuinely bores me.\n\nI can retake it in exactly a years time, but I turn 18 in 20 days and I don't know what my parents will think of me not having a job if I decide to retake it, with no guarantee that I'll pass the next time. Anyone else struggled with this kind of failure before? ",

I don't have ADHD, so I can't understand you that thoroughly but I'm in a similar situation hahaha, people evolve, it's normal to change and not only change yourself, also your friendships. Before you had a vision of life and your friends, and now it has changed, I recommend that you stay with them, find out if you can fit in again, if you feel very uncomfortable and see that the connection you shared with your friends is no longer there. Well, it's not the end of the world. It can be painful, like mourning, because they were part of you. So good luck and don't get overwhelmed, you can always make new friends!!"

It seems to me that sometimes what's called social anxiety is basically underdeveloped social skills, which is why I like to tell people about the Dale Carnegie book.\n\n I'll mention two books that can help. Handbook of Self-Help Therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that the writings of Barbara Markway help people with moderate social anxiety. Her most recent book is Painfully Shy. How to Win Friends and Influence People has been a best seller for generations.\n\nSlow breathing can help with awkward social situations and phobias. You can get good and relaxed, then imagine yourself in a situation that makes you nervous.  Doctors recommend a simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, 6 sec inhale and 6 sec exhale.\n\nYou can also slow your breathing just before and during a conversation.\n\nThere is some evidence that mindfulness helps. Apps like Headspace are very popular. Mindful Life Project is easy to use and free.\n\nOne of the best OPs I’ve seen in a long time -\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/11bl77y/the\\_best\\_thing\\_i\\_did\\_to\\_improve\\_my\\_social\\_anxiety/](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/11bl77y/the_best_thing_i_did_to_improve_my_social_anxiety/)"

I spent the first 19 years of my life being savaged and brutalized in any way you can imagine which lead to drugs, then that prison sentence where it happened some more. I got out, was going to off myself, and found the love of my life. She helped me find help, which lead to me being aggressive in finding my own answers to my own problems along with therapy and a psyche doctor. I found mushrooms(I don't endorse or advise the use of drugs) and finally Ketamine therapy which was the first thing to touch my PTSD or Treatment resistant depression in 30 years. So now I cry and listen to music and love my fiance. I think the future of mental health lies in the hands of psychedelics personally."

        "body": "I used to be pretty bad with drugs and acting recklessly like driving crazy and getting involved in conflict, but those aren’t healthy ways. I kind of had to learn on my own to let myself not be ok without letting myself fall into negative actions, which is especially hard as a high school kid, but the things I listen above are only going to hurt you.\n\nSomething positive that’s helped me is allowing myself to feel negative emotions instead of always trying to feel happier. As simple as it sounds, not many people let themselves feel sad, angry or in pain. Usually they just experience the emotion but try to get over it. Try to give yourself time and space to cry and feel pain, whether that’s at night, in your car, or anywhere else, and just let it happen. Don’t worry about the outside world, just become connected with yourself. \n\nAlso something that helped me is “giving myself” the people who I need for support. I never really had parents or close family, so speaking out loud to myself gives me the feeling of care. I’ve always felt alone and laying in bed, softly saying comforting things out loud like “I love you” and “You’re going to be ok” as well as motivating things like “You did so good today” and “You’ve come so far and I’m proud of you.”\n\nAlso holding a pillow helps you not feel alone, I like pairing that with comforting myself.\n\nOne more thing that I’ve found helps which may sound crazy is I like to take headphones and listen to these asmr comfort videos on YouTube, where someone will “talk, comfort and listen” to you and let you cry. I put those in quotations because I know nobody is actually there with you actively helping you, but it feels so peaceful in the mind being able to cry, mourn or grieve with somebody who treats you with the care you’ve always wanted. \nIt’s honestly helped me because I’ve always had attachment issues and have wanted comfort from a girl. Call me crazy lol\n\nAnyway, coping is different from everybody and for different reasons. Take the time to reflect on yourself and find what works for you. Just make sure it’s healthy and constructive. Love you 🫶"

I write things down in a statement way and then solve the puzzle of what is the best way forwards. You can ask for advice or thoughts from others, but in the end its you who makes the decisions. Everyone is diffetent and has different way of approaching things. I try to take things not as serious. I don't mean that you live whatever and whenever, not doing any plans for future etc. But being open minded and able to flex in situations is helpful. Instead of obsessing and crying over everything, even the smallest things, understand that shit happens in life and you have to chooce which battles you will fight and which you wont. Put your time and energy into what matters to you the most."

For those who haven't been and think \"I can just talk to my friends/family,\" it's actually SO freeing to talk to someone you don't know. A good therapist won't tell you what to do with your life, and no matter what you tell them you've done, they won't look down on you for it. As well-intentioned as the people in our life are, they all have an opinion or a stake in how you act, so they're going to sway you in some way. Therapists typically don't do this unless it's a matter of safety. Instead, they'll just help you clarify how you're feeling so you are empowered to make the right decisions for yourself."

        "body": "Hi, I am a 23 year old man and have had varying levels of mental health struggles. I attempted to take medications to help with anxiety and depression, but the side effects and overall lack of progress deterred me from continuing. I also attempted to try therapy and had a bad experience as the therapist called me by the wrong name on numerous occasions and told me to train for a marathon because that helped her in the past. I expressed that I really wanted to talk about some of the happenings in my life but it seemed I was being brushed over. \n\nMy mental health fluctuates greatly. Some days I feel neutral, others I feel worthless. I have noticed that, even around the people I love, it is far more difficult to get a laugh out of me on any given day. \n\nRecently, and for the past couple of years, I have been experiencing terrible dissociation. At times I feel what I assume is existential panic and get very dizzy, confused, and sometimes zone out completely to anyone trying to gain my attention. \nI have been able to live with this, sleep paralysis, and my other mental health struggles for quite some time, but last night something happened that basically forced me to ask for some sort of guidance. (My wife is wonderful and works in the psychology field, but we all know that partners can not be your “fix all”) \n\nLast night I had been having very detailed nightmares and of course, poor sleep. I woke up yelling twice. Once in fear, and the other time I was calling for my dog because I had dreamed that he had been taken. I have talked and yelled in my sleep other times too, but this was still not the worst part. \nWhen I woke up on one occasion, I did not feel real. My face was tingling and numb, I touched my face and head but couldn’t feel anything, and it felt like my mind/thoughts were slipping away. I can’t accurately describe how terrible this felt, but I truly did not feel… I just didn’t feel! \n\nApart from my sleep, I have felt very dissociated at night when I walk the dog, when I am alone, and sometimes in public settings as well. Two times in my life I have fainted from the dizziness and confusion. \n\nThere’s a lot more I could talk about, but I thought I would start with the dissociation/depersonalization. I’d like to know what I should do and if there’s any practices I can do to be better. I’m frightened often and do not want to put a strain on family or friends. I have had a lot of life events to happen recently including the passing of my grandpa (who was basically my best friend) and I’m sure that hasn’t helped with my mental health. \n\nI hope this rambling made sense to someone, I look forward to any advice!",

        "body": "my advice to you would be to try to push yourself out of your comfort zone and to try new things putting the anxiety and demotivation aside as overtime it could help reprogram your brain to move beyond its “presumed” limitations and what you can and cant do could be slowly refined overtime. Also ive found meditation or just overall mindfulness is extremely helpful for me and my severe anxiety disorder, reading or just educating myself about meditation and the possibilities of it helping helps me and gives me a spark of hope sometimes even if i don’t meditate all of the time. I am by no means a medical professional but ive done plenty of my own research on how to cure my mental health or at very least help the most i can without medication as ive also had very bad experiences. Hope this helps and i hope you get better soon! (20yr old Male btw)"

I have advice from experts about self-help that you can consider and talk about with your wife.\n\nAbout that problem you mention,  the Psychology Today article mentions simple grounding exercises for derealization.\n\nI'll give you some examples of grounding exercises.\n\nEat a handful of raisins or nuts very slowly, appreciating every piece, taking a long time to finish them, being aware of your slow breathing.\n\nWash and dry the dishes very carefully, focusing on what you're doing, the feelings in your hands and the sound of the water.\n\nExamine objects. Pick up a  few objects, name them, feel them and carefully inspect them.\n\nCount things.\n\nBreathing slowly through your nose, be aware of bodily sensations - the air passing through your nostrils, the feeling of your clothing on your skin, the pressure of the floor on the soles of your feet. Look around at the room, aware of the present moment, the here and now.\n\nYou can't go wrong with stress management. It's something we all need and it can help with anxiety and depression, especially when combined with the standard treatments. \n\nOne of the simplest stress reduction methods is one of the best - slow breathing.\n\nTwo psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise - 5 breaths a min - is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each."

        "body": "To get straight to the point. i legit have a fear of blushing and it’s been restricting so many things in my life. So basically when i was in highschool my dad used to bully me and embarass me for no reason. He would always claim that he loves me a lot and the ways he expresses his “love” was very aggressive. It gotten to the point where he would be physical with me. I would always confront him and tell him that it irritates me and he would get upset. Then he would play victim because he said his dad abused him so that’s why he’s messed up in the head and I would forgive him. but anyways, sometimes he would scold me for the tinniest things because he expect me to be the best out of the best because he put me through school etc. so am expected to know everything. He would literally bully me and call me names if I did not know what the definition of what a word means when he asks me. \n\nFlash forward, i feel like this messed me up mentally now because it happened ever since i was 14. I am 24 now and literally everytime when someone says something at school like “didn’t the professor go over this with you in class already” , i get flashback about how my dad used to scold me about not knowing something and bullied me. so i would start activating my panic mode and blush so hard and things would get so uncomfortable. I can just have a conversation with someone then suddenly my face just turns red and i would freeze because i always feel like they will either scold me about something. I am not a very shy person and i can make friends easily and i am pretty socially active with strangers, but like when i am close with someone in a 1v1 convo it just makes me so uncomfortable. Is something wrong with me? ",

        "body": "I guess I just want to type this out and get it all off my chest. \n\nI am...struggling lately for apparently no reason. I am a limited licensed social worker in Michigan. I'm a social worker who can't get their own mental health in order apparently and it feels a bit...crumby. \n\nI landed a great job with a local county in a recidivism reduction program. Caseload is around 40. I run a substance use group and a cognitive behavioral group. It's really a great job in terms of work/life balance, too, as I don't work weekends. No on call. Great payscale. Commute is 30 minutes which isn't too bad. \n\nI have an amazing boyfriend who has been nothing but supportive while I struggle. It makes me feel so bad that he has to deal with this. \n\nMy point is. I shouldn't be struggling like this, I have no reason to be struggling. \n\nI have Major Depressive Dissorder, but I am very functional because, well...what choice do I have? I have bills to pay. I can't not work. I've always just kinda \"powered through\". \n\nBut lately, I just...can't. I don't know what is wrong with me. I am crying every day, crying in my office at work because I don't want to be here. I'm sleeping SO much. I even fell asleep in my office, and upper management spoke to me about it (which kinda made my mental health worse because then I felt like a complete failure at my job). I can't focus. I have no motivation to do anything; either at home or work. The apathy I am experiencing is driving my insane. \n\nThe worse is the fatigue. I think maybe my Lexapro is causing it. I had to pull off the road due to seeing double from the fatigue. I get good sleep too (solid 8-9 hours).\n\nI used to work out and that made me feel good but then my job went back in person \"for the office environment\" and then soon after I started the Lexapro. I'm too tired to work out and can't find the motivation anymore. I've gained weight, which makes me feel worse yet. \n\nNever in my life has my depression been this bad, and I feel like a failure because there is no reason for it to be like this. \n\nI think I just need... some time. Either inpatient or some intensive outpatient. Get medications that work for me. But I don't have the PTO for that, so I was looking into short-term disability as I qualify, and it supplements 60% of my pay while I am off. \n\nBut I almost feel ashamed that I might do this. Like... I eventually want to be a supervisor at my job and I'm afraid that taking leave knocks me off that track. \n\nAnyways. Like I said, I just needed to get all that typed out as it makes me feel a little better. ",

Maybe your soul is trying to communicate that something is wrong. Are you sure this is the career path for you? Could there be a healing path for you that you can then offer to others as a way to get better? \n\nDo you have enough nature connection time? Do you have enough creative time?

        "body": "I don’t know what to do.\n\nAround 3 months ago I found out that my wife was cheating on me. Meeting guys on Tinder and bars and all that goes with it. I keep giving her chance after chance after chance since then… because things keep happening. I don’t want to get into all of it, but things like, still texting one of the tinder guys every day for two weeks and eventually meeting with him. Anyway, there’s a whole lot more to it but it’s not why I’m here. \n\nShe volunteered to give up all her social media as an effort to build trust. She had me watch as she blocked them and deactivated all her socials, as well as in her phone. I did the same in a show of solidarity. We packed up our things and moved out of the suburbs and temporarily moved with my brother until we find a place. We came down here to try and “start over.”\n\nA week ago I found out that she had downloaded Tinder (downstairs on my brothers couch) while I was sleeping that night. At like 4:00 am. She claims she didn’t do anything on it or talk to anyone or even swipe. She said she didn’t do anything else or talk to anyone. Since then the conversations about breaking up got more serious.\n\nJust a few days ago, I found out that she sent a letter to Tinder guy she was texting. Tbh, I wish I didn’t know this one. A letter? She says it was for closure and no return address and doesn’t want a response. She “can’t because of no social media”, but she doesn’t know that I know the real truth. She still has strange/confusing feelings for him. The letter was sweet.  She’s hoping for a response, she went as far as putting an envelope inside of the envelope she sent. That way, there is no return address visible in the outside. \n\nThis was a final straw and I finally broke things off. But she literally begged me aconvinced me to give her one last drastic try. We had really heartfelt talks, promised that she has nothing else nothing else to hideand she decided she going check herself into the hospital. I’ve stuck to my boundaries and have maintained that I’m serious about being done but I’ll wait until she’s out of treatment and then revisit things. Giving her the “one last try.”\n\nYou gotta understand, I love her. We’ve been married for 14 years. \n\nJust a few hours ago. I found out she was still lying. That night she downloaded Tinder, she also reactivated her snap and Instagram (which she used to talk to them. Which she did in fact talk on snap chat with who the hell knows that night, including at least one from an incident in the past. She’s had them downloaded for a while now actually. \n\nThere’s so much more to this entire story, but I’ve already gone on longer than I intended. \n\nI’m just done with the lies, little ones, big ones. I just can’t take it anymore. I don’t trust her at all. I believe nothing she says. And she’s broken my heart too many times over the past three months.\n\nI’m supposed to bring her to the hospital today.  She has hope that it will fix our relationship. But after knowing everything I know now, the many more lies she’s told, and having proof of it. I’m done. I’m out of chances to give.\n\nI don’t want to tell her I want a divorce. the hospital. I feel like that would be cruel. But I can’t tell her before we go because she will refuse to go and she will NOT be safe. I’m scared for her.\n\nThis is so hard.\n\nI don’t know what to do.\n\n\nPs I didn’t mention that we both have personality disorders, PTSD, and a bunch of other letters too. So this is really hard and confusing for both of us",

If everyone had a switch to \"turn themselves off\" painlessly and permanently, I think the world population would decrease dramatically. And yet many of us are still here because we *don't* have such a switch. Living is hard, but dying by your own hand is also hard. The way I look at it, this means that we have to choose which hard path to take, every day of our lives."

        "body": "For context, I suffer from a number of disorders such as MDD, ADD, and possibly autism. I’ve always found it hard to say no. But when it came to sexual boundaries, I’ve always forced myself into making it clear. However for the past couple of months, I found myself having onset dissociation symptoms/feelings. I don’t usually experience those, but they affect the way I act in every situation. I often agree to things I really really don’t want to. No matter how much I hate doing it, I just don’t have the mental capacity or patience to still say no if someone insists on something, and i’m not in touch with myself enough for it to sink in at the moment.\nLately, (about a month or so ago) a friend of mine tried to make sexual advances on me. I said no and it wasn’t taken seriously, but upon a second or third attempt, I easily give in. And that happened many times over the past month. He even insisted on becoming my boyfriend and I ended up caving even though I didn’t want it. Every time it gets more intimate and I end up giving in. It feels like rape but at the same time I did agree with it because I couldn’t bring myself to say no enough times. I hate myself for it. When I brought it up with him, he said I said no but ended up going for it if he insisted enough, and for the record I’d try to push his hand away but give in in only a few seconds. I feel like I’m being raped and harassed but at the same time I’m allowing it to happen so I also have no one to blame but myself. I don’t understand why I don’t fight for myself, it puzzles me too and I don’t know if I can even blame him. For the record, I’m also a “virgin” and saving myself, never even went past making out, but at this point he even put it in at some point. Looking back at it is very traumatizing but yet I allow it to happen. Am I really at fault here or is this just the effect of whatever mental distress I’m going through? ",

As someone who have problem saying no and with mental health problem, I know the feeling. It a process to build yourself up to have confidence as well as maintain a firm boundary \n\nA rule I taught myself is that you gonna disappoint someone at some point, especially for refusal. But compare to being their piece of clay to mold, you can become someone you can be happy and proud to be. Be kind yourself, stranger. We all have our moments of weaknesses, it how we keep climbing back up after them that define our lives."

But the online scenarios I was in where people kept wanting to sext with me, it became difficult to say no. Especially when I got a deep craving for validation and acceptance.\n\nI ended up in a lot of bad spots, nearly got r***d once as a result. Took me until just this year to really make a significant change.\n\nIt is a difficult thing to deal with and it really depends on your social environment. If you're consistently friends with sexual people, it doesn't help stave off that sort of feeling.\n\nDo your best to surround yourself with good people, then slowly reteach your mind that your body is sacred and you should protect it from the unworthy."

When I started confronting him about his behavior, he'd suddenly have mood swings, be passive aggressive, insist that things were my fault, etc. It's hard to come forward since I've got a reputation to keep, and of course he knew that, at the same time I'm somewhat relieved that he wasn't ever able to take my virginity, nor kiss me on the mouth. I still have with me the things that are personally most important to me. I've always been known as smart (not to brag), and looking back again, I'm quite relieved that I didn't totally abandon my senses. Still, there's still damage. Though I still remained well-accomplished despite everything, my realizations now in my early twenties are making me angrier at him. Honestly, I want to k1ll him with my bare hands.

It’s getting super hard to take care of myself, I am struggling in school, and I am constantly feeling dread. I can barely get up in the morning. I want to die but not currently planning anything because I made a promise not to kill myself, as long as the person I made the promise with didn’t do anything to themself. I wouldn’t go for suicidal ideation or anything but for the fact I am struggling to pay attention, take care of myself, talk, so much other stuff, I don’t know if I could go to the hospital or not but I am thinking about it, if I can. A hospital might help me enough while I’m there and take a lot of stuff off my shoulders to help stop or slow my spiral. I’ve been spiraling really bad for months now and it’s only gotten worse. If this keeps up I will go crazy, I want help. Not exaggerating when I say crazy. It’s happened before but because of all this build up it might be worse this time around. Do you think I could go?? What would they do? If I went to the ER would they do something? What would be different? I’m really thinking of going but I’m scared I won’t be able to go or shouldn’t because I’m not actively thinking or trying to kill myself. Someone help me please. I am going to discuss with my therapist tomorrow but I really really would like to know a little bit or if I would even be able to go. \n\nI am sorry if this is the wrong flair, I didn’t know what to put.",

I just want you to recognise that and not to downplay how you're feeling because your feelings are important and valid. \n\nWith that said, you can go to the hospital. It's often a good place to go if you're not feeling safe. In terms of what will happen if you do go, I can't say for sure. If you're really honest with them about how you are feeling then they may want you to talk to a mental health professional while you are there or refer you on to see someone at a later date. \n\nRemember though, visiting ER doesn't automatically make everything feel better, especially with mental health. It's better to see ER as a short-term, immediate 'fix' in that it will help keep you safe and potentially able to access other support. But the longer-term stuff takes time."

Then at my age 15 I came to know about philosophy and I use to waste my time on it which is used to see in phone I never went outside at this time I completely isolated myself from the world thinking I have live in my own world. It felt very good at that time. Also I wasted all my time in phone watching philosophy movie reviews movie analysis deep lore game reviews instead of playing games and watch those movies. How to be better than as I was very competative how to be a genius like Albert Einstein how to be prefect like Leonardo da vinci and many more. Then from 16-17 I lowered down the philosophy part keeping movies review analysis constant then I shifted my thinking in people birthday analysis how birthday determines your overall personality then I would compare of people which I thought were better than me . I also started writing analysis of people. And till now I have literally wasted all my time on all this . I am very boring person whenever I try to talk to others they think I am a negative person because I talk in deep with others I cannot make jokes like they in mid the conversations due to this I have no friends that why since childhood I had very few friends and now I am 18 I have none. I have no creativity in me. I am not that straight forward person. I don't even know who I am.  I am too much competative I compare every aspect of Me every little detail of others to myself.

I can't make decisions at work, I'm generally ok with whatever decision is made even though I'm supposed to make the decisions at work. It's affecting heavily now. I'm about to cross 30 in a few years and I'm afraid to start a family even because I'm afraid  either I'll fail financially or else my spouse will bully me over not being able to any decision. I have talked about this a lot of times with my parents but they think I'm incapable and egoistic that I'm telling this. They decided to put me in a college and select my degree and even buying me a seat there even though I was willing to sit and write the exam for the same college and course. My whole college life went on trying to prove myself even by achieving tiny things and trying to take fake pride out of that. I got interested in one topic in college, although was no way good at that but still felt happy. The ripples of my failed self esteem carried forward to my first employment where I couldn't sustain at the job. Although later on I was able to catch up and was okay with growing slowly and learning aptly to take big leaps later on, I was forced to sign up for an employment course where again my self esteem was challenged because after a very long time I felt settled at job and was enjoying the long working hours even. Although because of someone else's effort I was able to go through the interview but I'm experiencing a blank feeling, a feeling where you feel nothing and are okay with everything. Lot of times I thought better to quit than lead such a vague life but don't know why I'm still here. I don't know what God has planned for me, but I have lost faith in myself, I just want to sleep and never wake up. It hurts, the feeling of nothingness hurts, I guess this is what life is.",

She was indicating she wasn't doing well right from the time she got up and then while I was driving to school she went into a full on panick attack. I kept trying to get her calm down with the goal of getting her to school. She was just screaming over me and saying some really self harming things. Well I slapped her thigh really hard. Harder than I intended and obviously I feel terrible but that was the worst thing I could have done for her. I am open to all any thoughts around this. ",

It sounds like you already talked to her about it and apologized, she's seeing mental health professionals. The whole thing was a teaching moment for both you and your daughter, with a few lessons imo: Adults get overwhelmed too. People react to the way I act. Mistakes happen. Take ownership of the mistakes you make. Communicate your feelings. Responsibility, accountability, empathy.  \n\nIf I can ask, you don't have to answer but maybe ask yourself...are you taking care of yourself, too? Do You have someone to go to when you're overwhelmed and feeling helpless? You can have the purest intentions in the world and try your hardest to be the perfect parent, but you gotta put your own mask on first to be able to help the people around you."

Mistakes happen all of the time. It's the only constant from the universe, it's how we deal with our mistakes that makes us the people we are. Apologizing sincerely and putting in effort to rebuild the connection (your sweet moments with your child) is the best thing you can do. If your comfortable with it maybe bring it up with the therapist and work through it together."

Slow breathing is often recommended, but deep breathing tends to promote hyperventilation, making it hard for people to breathe. Many people use slow breathing self-help successfully.\n\nThere's a treatment called interoceptive exposure therapy. It's teaching people not to fear the symptoms of the panic attack by deliberately bringing on the symptoms - for example by bringing on a fast heartbeat by aerobic exercise.\n\nMore panic info -\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/oxd2n8/got\\_any\\_advice\\_how\\_to\\_deal\\_with\\_anxieties\\_which/h7ng811/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/oxd2n8/got_any_advice_how_to_deal_with_anxieties_which/h7ng811/?context=3)"

It hurts me more than any physical pain. I want to cry it out, but my eyes swell up instantly and take forever to recover. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying. I don't even have any sad kdrama excuses anymore. I just don't want anyone to know how much I'm hurting inside. And to make things worse, there's no psychological help nearby. I don't think I'd feel comfortable with video call consultations either.\n\nOn the job front, I have a decent-paying job that I don't really have any complaints about. But I feel like I need to get out of my current environment and start fresh. The problem is, if I leave my job now, how will I support myself? What if I can't find another job that pays as well? I feel like I'm losing control of my emotions too quickly. I feel like I'm losing myself too quickly. I used to be able to keep it together, but I did not cry this much . It's like the pain I'm feeling is suffocating me, and sometimes I just want to slap myself to make it stop. I'm really scared of what I might do.\n\nI could really use some advice on how to deal with all of this and find the support I need.",

They just have their own lives and own families they have to care for too. I would imagine it isn’t easy for a therapist to leave their clients behind and take care of themselves. It isn’t personal at all. Try to be understanding and don’t think for a second it has anything to do with you personally. They will probably be able to refer you to someone they know and trust and they will be able to share their notes with."

Not saying you were but thats just how human perception works, I've been told I'm intimidating when I'm having a firm conversation even though that's not the intention.\n\n\nCould be your therapist was sick, their kids were sick, they themselves were having a personal crisis (even therapists need therapists) and that led to the short notice cancellation. The reason doesn't even matter, it's all just baggage now. You'll find someone better"

I would appreciate it so much if anyone is able to give any guidance on how to deal with this.\n\nMy brother is 62 and lives with my mother who is 90. He’s always had mental health issues and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in his teens. My family were from a generation where mental health was taboo so it was very hush hush.\n\nHe also has fibromyalgia and in the last 10 years has had other issues like light and sound sensitivity amongst other growing health issues. \n\nBefore the pandemic he told me he was diagnosed with angina but he can’t take the medication for it because it would clash with other medicine. Before this I had taken his illnesses completely serious perhaps wanting to see the best in him. It could also be my mother constantly crying to me about how ill he is that made me feel guilty to think otherwise. “Your poor brother.” \n\nHe went into hospital with severe chest pains a few months ago. I visited every evening after work for a week. He was on a high when he was there, talking so much and hard to make sense of what tests he had etc. So when I saw a doctor I called him over and asked if he had the test results. He went to get them and said he has a healthy heart with no signs of angina and they did every test there was. He discharged him. Since then he has been furious about how he was discharged without treatment. Any time I suggest going as an outpatient to have another opinion he says he doesn’t trust doctors and he is far too ill now to leave the house.\n\nHe has been verbally abusive to me, my husband and my kids. Saying personally horrible things and also that we don’t believe he’s ill and I’m spreading lies. He runs around screaming which is strange seeing as usually he walks with a stick and says he can’t breathe enough to talk for long. \n\nHe is now stopping my mum from having any helpers round due to fear of getting covid with his condition. The house is getting full of dust and clutter and they won’t let me help. To be honest I can’t go there alone anymore because he gets so aggressive and it scares me. \n\nMy mum is elderly and she has been manipulative herself in the past, but now she is vulnerable and it appears he is controlling her.\n\nI have no idea what to do.",

You can also look into applying for him to have a mental health act assessment so that he's potentially sectioned. He may just be an unpleasant person but it may be a flare up of his bipolar or even early onset dementia. Your poor mother shouldn't be living in misery, whatever the reason. It's worth you helping her get legal advice with regards to evicting him. Maybe even have a word with your local police about what's going on. A psychiatric hospital stay would be the best outcome as they can stabilise him and find him supported accommodation for when he's discharged."

But then they meet someone else who has only got one leg. This person might feel bad for losing their shoe but at least they have both their legs and on reflection they don't feel so bad anymore.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say. I was stunned. I expected a more professional answer than reducing it down to \"You shouldn't feel bad because other people have it worse\". \n\nI said: \"I don't live in Ukraine. I don't live in Gaza. I'm unlikely to get killed by a bomb tomorrow and there are other people with much worse lives. Perhaps it makes me incredibly shallow and self-centred to say that isn't very comforting. Knowing that other people have worse lives doesn't make me feel any better, if anything it's making me feel guilty. I don't see how it helps me to know that people in Ukraine could get killed by a bomb.\"\n\nShe then moved on to talking about God and how everything happens for a reason. I managed to steer the conversation onto the topic of antidepressant doses so I didn't need to get into that hornet's nest.",

If you are bringing this issue to a psychiatrist and this is the response you are getting, then I would say, run from this doctor as fast as you can. \n\nIf this doctor does not have the knowledge or the credentials to treat your emotional distress (a general practitioner, for example) you should look for someone who has. You can discuss mental issues with any doctor you want (even your eye doctor or your dentist) but you should not expect therapy-level insights from them. They are not trained to help you that way. \n\nThere are times when you need to talk to your family doctor about mental/emotional issues, specifically if you need them to refer you to a mental health professional (bloody HMOs!), but that's it. \n\nI hope you find the right professional with whom you will have a great rapport and soon be on your way to finding happiness. Good luck."

I would ask for a referral to a psychiatrist or else switch doctors.\n\nTrying to “talk you out of depression” this way is not a trauma-informed approach. It shows a fundamental misunderstanding of depression and does not even give you helpful advice, only dismissal. Outside of a prescription, advice might be something like get a light box, get exercise outside, take fish oil, do things you enjoy. Even so, that advice won’t necessarily help someone if the depression is too severe, but at least it’s more helpful than a clumsy analogy about shoes.\n\nMy therapist described this kind of thing as “correct but unhelpful”, because my dad would say things like “well you just need to get some sleep.” True. But in the presence of screaming anxiety and mania, unhelpful. It’s true that many people find meaningful spiritual connection to be helpful in making sense of their mental health issues and that can help with coping. But that is a very personal self-discovery journey people embark on organically - it is not helpful to tell someone to do it. It is true that gratitude and an other-focused perspective can help with dark introspection. But again, this is like step 10 of recovery from depression; when you’re in it, you’re struggling through your own pain and often cannot focus on other peoples’. It’s not helpful to suggest this before you’ve even started in on step 1."

I just nodded and smiled. I actually wasn't too bothered by this because I've already decided long ago that I wouldn't take \"other people have it worse\" arguments seriously. I just saw her as well-meaning but misguided.\n\nYou're absolutely right: knowing about the worse sufferings of others just makes me feel guilty for complaining about my own problems when I'm relatively privileged.

Should I let my avoidant non communicating ex back in my space.\n\nSo my mental health recently has been the worst possible. I feel ive completely lost my confidence after what happened with me. Earlier I was just naturally confident nowadays I some days have to fake it. and have to fake it people that I am doing all good. I cant really tell my parents everything and my friends in college are just some double faced snakes. Good in front of me ,bitching at back . I thought at max people would be asshole at an x level , but my god these are are just x squared levelled assholes. So i decided to part ways with them , soon I realised how lonely I felt. And being lonely soon started affecting my mental health and my interest in any activity dropped down to zero. Before this point i felt having a relationship at this age would be just a waste of time and I wasnt mature enough to handle a relationship and not financially independent yet. But, after the lonely phase I felt i seriously needed someone to talk to and share my feelings with someone who really understands me , listens to all my problems.(usually im enough for solving those just needed someone to vent and talk with and have a deep emotional connnect).  (Litlle bit of back story :And from my school there was a girl which I used to like but decided back then to avoid relationships at that age which was just very foolish of me. I thought it was just lust and nothing more. )  But I never really lost feelings for her. Fast forward we lost communication. And  in my lonely phase recently we connected on insta, I wanted to check what was she upto. I found out she actually loved me very deeply and she suffered a lot when I left her alone and \"ghosted\" her. Just by realising how much she suffered because of me I broke down to pieces further fucking my mental health up. To turn things better I confessed her and kind of apologised for \"ghosting\" . To which she replied she is into studies at that point of time. I took it as a rejection and never being back to the same again. A Month later she reached me out telling she wants me back. And mind you at that time I was mentally rebounded . I still let her back in my space. But this girl she fucking enjoys drama. Out of nothing she'll create something and make it so big. Her every word cuts me deep, still I allow her back in my space. Moreover she is always very indecisive. She changes her mind in seconds. Which doesnt affect her but fucking fucks my day up. She is always dancing between I want you I dont want you. One more thing she doesnt communicate anything openly. I thought it will take time to open up. And her actions and words have been determining my mood and mental health lately. And now Im really confused should I let her back in my space or just tell her to leave me alone. Which further is affecting my studies and upcoming semester exams too. She always makes me feel that Im too much. And I feel the efforts are near 0 from her side",

        "body": "You might be experiencing Maladaptive Daydreaming. It's when you spend a ton of time daydreaming, to the point you even dissociate into your daydreams, as a way of coping with extreme anxiety, stress, cognitive dissonance, trauma, etc. It is not a sign of psychosis or schizophrenia, but it can be an unhealthy coping mechanism. It's not officially recognized as a mental health disorder, but is a common symptom of anxiety, depression, trauma, etc. \n\nI occasionally slip into this too. I'm also a writer, and find it helps to put those daydreams into a story that I can write :) But the biggest thing for me was finding healthier coping mechanisms for my anxiety and addressing the root of my anxiety (with the help of a counselor!) It can also help to know what triggers your daydreaming. Like for me, if I had to transition from one activity to another, I would start to daydream and then oops- hours of my day have gone by. So I became super mindful of how I would transition and would play music really loudly or listen to a podcast so I don't get sucked into my own world. It's hard, really hard, at first to wean yourself off daydreaming, but it is possible!\n\nIt sucks though. I used to pace the length of my apartment for legit hours just daydreaming about different lives I would have liked to live or what would have happened if this happened and... yeah, it got kind of lonely and frustrating because I couldn't get anything productive done. I know it's cliche to say but it does get better.  You're not alone <3"

So, the moment when I started to analyze every detail of every conversation or relationship with people began 2 years ago, when  I was studying in 9th grade. I don’t know why but I started to see the hidden aura of every person, of my every friend. For instance, my friend said one minor thing, which I started to analyze and find the sense. Sometimes, I felt negative but others didn’t. I can feel the true intention of a person (I think so, but other people tell me that it’s wrong). But I don’t know, it seems like somebody has a strong charisma and impact, and can comport himself like an innocent person. \nAlso, besides this, when I’m contacting with girls (it isn’t hard for me but they are not interested in me, BUT I THINK THAT I’M A GOOD BOYFRIEND; I mean that I never drank, I never smoked, I always do sports like mixed martial arts, roller skating, and powerlifting, and I always care about others interests), I feel ashamed that I can strain her and so on, and because of this I can’t communicate with them normally. I see every detail in every conversation. I don’t know how to remove this quality and don’t be so vulnerable emotionally\n",

People say, \"I know there are things that will make me feel better - getting exercise, taking care of myself, straightening up the house and cleaning, but I'm depressed and I don't have the energy.\n\nHere's the thing - very important. People do have energy when they're depressed - as much energy as they always do, but for some reason, the system is reluctant to let you use your energy.\n\nWe have to use psychology to coax energy out of our systems.\n\nPsychology has some nifty tricks -\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj70w9ZbZng&t=460s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj70w9ZbZng&t=460s)\n\nYou don't have to be an athlete to benefit from exercise. As little as 20 min brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much and quit. Steve Ilardi, the therapist/researcher who headed the lifestyle-depression project at the Univ of Kansas, talks about enjoyable ways to get exercise. If you go to Metapsychology, you can read a psychologist's review of Dr Ilardi's book (\"splendid\").\n\nRelaxation eases the symptoms of depression. The Asian method with the best evidence is slow breathing. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min in the early morning and at bedtime is a therapy. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.\n\nA good habit - always respond to a moment of stress by breathing slowly.\n\nExcellent site - \n\n[StudentsAgainstDepression.org](https://StudentsAgainstDepression.org) \\- run by students and supervised by professionals."

        "body": "Hey everyone who may read this, I thought this may be a good place to share this on the chance that someone who is feeling suicidal reads it and changes their mind. \n\nA few years back, a close friend of mine from my teenage years killed himself. We hadn't been in contact in a while at the time, but he was someone I had such fun with and amazing memories of. The memories where you reminisce as being the \"good old days\" all have him in them. Hearing about his death absolutely broke me. Still to this day I will think about him at least once. \n\nNow that I am a few years older than he will ever get the chance to be, the grief seems to come back up again in waves. Knowing he's missing from parties, events, or even just casual hang outs hurts. There's always small reminders that he is missing but should be there. \n\nIt was so out of the blue to everyone around him. I only just wish he knew how many people miss him. How the world is not a better place without him in it. Even if that's what he was thinking at the time he ended his life. I wish he knew his brain was lying to him in that moment. That even though life was shitty, he wasn't ever actually alone. He is loved and always will be. \n\nSo, to anyone who is feeling suicidal (I've been there too) I just want you to know the world IS NOT a better place without you. You are NOT a burden. If you're not around, people you don't even realise you've impacted in some way WILL miss you. Will grieve you. Will wish you were still here.\n\nYes, life does go on regardless. But that doesn't mean it goes on without you being in anyone's thoughts. That's so far from the truth I don't even know how to put it in to words properly. \n\nI know that as I go through life and hit all the big milestones of starting a family, marriage, etc., I am still going to have my friend in my mind daily. I often sometimes still have dreams about him and they feel so real, they normally end with him giving me a hug before I then wake up. \n\nAnyway, thank you for reading this. \n\nI'll miss you forever, friend.

        "body": "Why is it that mental health practictioners, particularly the ones who work in A & E (I don't mean therapists or psychiatrists) really suck at their job. Its sometimes like they have come from incredibly privileged lives in which they haven't had to live through trauma like we have or feeling so different from the rest of society.\n\nAlso I understand some professionals are naturally coming from a objective view point, they ave to make judgements calls and can question your feelings and emotions as that's their job, and even ones that feel apathetic as they see soo many people but this one in particualr made me feel soo much worse, seemed unepathetic. Although the nurses were really nice and honestly do a better job at helping me than any A & E mental health profession I've talked to.\n\nCaution; mention of self harm and suicide\n\n\n\nSo yesterday I overdosed, instantly regretted it and took myself to A & E. I had my typical tests ext. But 11 hours I waited to talk to a member of the mental health team. This person was honestly a deplorable human being. She asked why I did it and the normal questions, I explained to her that I've been struggling with suicidal ideation, depression, my emptiness, self harm ext. my undiagnosed autism (I'm not a tiktoker self diagnoser, my twin has it and I know I also do as well for years)\n\nSo after telling her about my traumas which include domestic abuse, sexual assault, emotional abuse, dealing with a suicidal mother, neglect, bullying all the nine years at a very young age, this person decided to tell me that i couldn't be misrable or depressed because I regretted my overdose, I tried explaining that most people regret their attempts at suicide and I was scared, and that it wasn't the point my point was that I've been getting worse over the last year as I just attempted, she was like but you regretted it and argued I can't be in a bad state. She proceeded to tell me the reason I'm soo bloody misrable and empty and lonely (I explained these and said these feeling were getting more intense along side my self harm getting worse and losing my friends and the meaning in life) is because I choose to be, and that if I wanted to be happy and social ext. I would try to change that. I got angry and told her I've been trying to change that for 15 years, and that for me it seems to be a fundamental issue, and that's why I wanted therapy. She still argued with me. Then proceeded to tell me autism doesn't make life any harder, she tried saying that because they are happy and intelligent autistic people, like wtf? They're paraplegic athletes, doesn't mean its not harder for them to run. \n\nThe conversation kept going with 100 other examples and her telling me that we should just focus on support loans and university counselling, both I've done multiple times and I told her they haven't helped, so i said i dont want a support plan or safety plan, i already have one anyways with my previous counsellor that helped a little, she then went on to say okay it's your choice to decline the care and if you progress worse that's your fault, I tried explaining I'm not denying care as a whole I'm simply explaining what works and what doesn't, and that again I need trauma informed therapy or at least the chance to discuss options instead of being told for the 1000th time to try uni counselling which hasn't helped. She even said it's my fault for quitting talking g therapy, I explained i didn't and that my therapist let me go because she felt that talking therapies was no adequate and that I needed something more specialized.\n\nMore conversations about how autism isn't actually a disorder ext. And that I can't be that bad and getting worse, this person made me feel angry, dehumanised, not listened to and more suicidal. \n\nI asked if I could leave because it was making me feel worse and it was 5am and I was tired, she told me how I expect to get better if I deny their care, I explained I'm not denying care but I'm super tired and I have a telephone appointment with a mental health professional at 10am anyways, so I need to prioritize that as I've waited months for it as well as the fact that the \"care\" was making me feel worse and that the doctor said i could go home, she simply repeated herself multiple times.\n\nAfter I came out into the waiting area in tears, the people who were waiting with me were great and helped calm me down.",

My private trauma therapist is helping me work through all the trauma I've suffered, including abuse at the hands of NHS staff."

I just thought telling them, hey my mum abused me and my dad told me what to say in all my assessments would be enough to make them think, yeah let’s give this woman an assessment. But apparently not which sucked. I’ve found another place which I’ll email though and I don’t think I’ll mention any type of assessment. I’m sorry to hear you were dismissed too though. I remember telling people my mum used to beat me up and their response was wellll she’s still your mum and I think it’s really mean you’re not trying to get on with her."

        "body": "I, (F21), and boyfriend, (M21) have a very cute, communicative relationship. We’ve been together for a year. \n\nAbout a month into our relationship, I learned he had sex with someone in our friend group while he was dating me.Multiple times. \n\nHere’s the thing, though, the lines were super blurry. He tells me he didn’t feel like he was in control, and that he was pressured. I want to believe him, it goes against my morals not to, but clearly I feel like this is something he participated in willingly. I think it’s because when I found out I was going off of that belief because of limited information, and that’s the basis of this trauma.\n\nI have ocd and this traumatized the hell out of me. I can’t forget or accept that this happened, even a year after the mess. There’s not a day where I don’t think of it, barely an hour where it doesn’t cross my mind. And these wounds definitely affect our relationship. I already had trust issues before we got together, and mixed with ocd I feel like I can never fully trust that I’m not being betrayed again. \n\nThis man makes me happy, loves me, expresses how much he doesn’t want to lose me, and definitely has remorse for what happened. I love him, I think of him and smile, but that smile fades quickly because I can’t forget what he did to me, and that feeling hurts immensely. It doesn’t feel good to look at him and feel so happy and feel so much love, and feel it quickly turn into intense pain and resistance. \n\nI don’t know if anyones been in this kind of situation, but I’m open to any advice or comment. I’m in therapy, and I’ve definitely improved, but this ruined my quality of life. \n\nHow do I move on from this?\n\nTLDR; My boyfriend slept with someone else early in our relationship before we were official. It’s fucked up my mental health and I need help",

        "body": "In my humble opinion, your relationship started with a lie that was never fully explained and that is why it does not give you peace of mind. I want you to know that what you feel matters and is real. Your heart feels that something is wrong and that the rest is a bit like an illusion covering up the truth. In my humble opinion, your boyfriend is someone for whom you were an option at one point in time, just like that other person in your group of friends. He made the decision of his own free will to have sex with someone other than you, especially since it took place several times, as you say. Both of you were options, from which he then ultimately chose you. \n\nI understand why you feel the way you do. Despite what you have now, your heart is not at peace with you in the respect that there was a time when you chose him but he did not choose you and treated you as an option. This feeling you feel in your heart can be described with the questions: \"How can I be sure of someone who was not sure of me? How can I be with someone who didn't choose me straight away, the way I chose him?\". Unfortunately, my dear, but I know too little about you, him and the relationship that unites you to give any concrete advice, but I think that if you follow the search for the answers to the questions I have posed, in time you will find the right answer for you. Know that the right answer will be the one towards which you feel complete peace and rightness, even if it is a difficult decision. Don't see it through the prism of difficulty, but through the prism of rightness. I cheer for you 😊 Much love to you ❤️"

He was depressed but so am I. He didn't seek help. The worst thing he ever did to me, He threatened to kill himself and said \"it's because of you\".  I should have left him then. But I am too weak. \nI need to list this things before I feel weak again and try to message him. I should stay away. \nWe had happy moments too but the bad things are heavier on my mind.

I feel like external validation feels good when we don't give ourselves enough attention. Try to do things you enjoy in your own company, its harder than it sounds, but doing something small each day, or rewarding yourself for the work you do each day is one way I think this should help."

I’m not too sure how to explain it? It feels like everything I’m doing isn’t actually my actions. I show up to campus, study, eat, socialize, all that, but it feels surreal. I understand that yes, I did those things. But it feels like I didn’t. It’s leading to a lack of motivation and drive for personal and academic projects as well as just a general feeling of apathy and sadness when I know those aren’t necessarily things I should feel. I dunno. Just felt like writing this here.",

        "body": "It’s been 2 years since my dad died due to COVID and the reality has only been settling into my subconscious and conscious mind recently. Till last year I would ignore any thoughts of it happening and I didn’t even cry at his funeral or after because I knew how much pain I would have to confront. But last year , moving out of town and living alone , my grief confronted me. I would never leave my room, I never ate , showered or spoke to my roommates for most days I was a ghost. My alcohol abuse was bad and I would smoke at least 2 joints a day. I dropped out of law school thinking it was too focus on my business career but I’ve realised now that my dad was my true motivation to get a degree. I came out of a toxic relationship and realised that I was only tolerating my exs shit as a distraction from my life that’s been falling apart. My mom has been discreetly toxic af for most of my life. We used to fight a lot when I was a teen but now my mom and I talk even though recently she lied and scammed me of some of my father’s inheritance but I still love and visit her because I care about her.  No in my family knows I dropped out but I’ve been accepted again at another school to complete my studies. I’m really trying. Fast forward to 2024 I’m seeing a psychologist, I’m turning 22 tomorrow, I can barely express myself when talking to my psychologist about how it’s still hard for me to get out of bed. I’m writing this in bed, I’ve not eaten today and I just poured myself a glass of wine. I stopped taking my antidepressants, I was diagnosed with bipolar depression and my iron medicine. I’m in another emotionally abusive relationship and I feel stuck because I’m no good alone. I’m 21 and he’s 70.  I chased most of my friends away, I was very angry after my dad died and they tried reaching out to me but I can’t keep company. I’m struggling and I’m not myself at the moment , I feel too tired to be alive and I just wish I could find the old me before everything became such a mess inside my mind. I want to find my lost lust for life , the old me who wake up to dress up , look beautiful, exercise and socialise with people. The intelligent me who would pursue any idea she put her mind too. I just wish someone could help me find her. But being an adult we only have ourselves, how am I going to be able to get myself out of this ? ",

You may be an adult, but your not alone. I'm here. I can help. I'm here OK? We will fight this together. If you need to let out grief I find it really helpful to right a letter. I right mine about all the things I miss about him, and all the things I've done. After that, I fold them up, put them in an envelope and put them away. You can do whatever. Just right whatever is making you sad, and put it in a draw. It can't hurt you there. Also, never forget I am here. If you need someone to talk to I'm here . We got this"

I am actually here to help people, write with strangers and it actually kinda helps myself to calm myself down. I actually see reddit as a comfort zone now for last months. Ive been very active, not only in the mental health sub. But back to you.\n\nI guess its a normal feeling in youre current sitiation and the place you are. You dont have to feel alone there, there are MANY Others that feel like that. I could tell you to focus on stuff you like to get a better feeling on stuff you do, to kinda get a bit of motivation back. Like drawing or making music, anything you like. Or maybe there was a hobby you had as a kid, but sadly gave up on it. Or maybe try something new? Like writing a novel or baking? \n\nI can recommend, cause i would guess you think a lot, do a little walk and listen to some music. I usually go alot on nightwalks that can go like over 5hours by just walking through the empty streets from the city i live in. Its calming down and helps me get my head empty. Sure my problems dont go away, but its defently a difference by thinking while walking than thinking in school/work. I got myself into reading again, now i read some novels while im at a park at night.\n\nDont look back on bad stuff that happend, like things you might feel miserable or your childhood or sm. Focus more on stuff you actually enjoy, try to make conversations. I know its hard. I cant even do that. And thats why i am here, to get my social status filled. I write more on reddit than i talk with people irl.\n\nI know, there are people, like me, out there that would be there for you, even when its just writing in a privat chat on reddit. Its even better when the other person is a stranger. My ears are all up for you."

He was pumping my self esteem as no one else and always made me feel like I know what is the purpose of life and what direction I should go. Most of this went gone with him. I found some comfort in accepting that a loss is a loss and I will always miss him and the life I had in general. A loss of a significant family member often changes a lot of things - in case of my fam, everything went upside down. 13 years later, I still feel like I’m living a different life, without connection to my younger years. This is the time when I should take the steering wheel and build my own legacy, but I feel so powerless to do so, despite good/great career, lovely kids etc I feel like life breached a contract we had. It all feels a bit „meh” without my dad telling me how proud he is and how successful I am. For emotional type of human beings, especially over-thinkers, keeping optimism in daily life is a sort of heroism."

If not, there’s a lot of resources online for mental health.\n\nIn my experience having a similar issue what helps me are affirmations, which might feel silly, relaxation techniques, and exposure, which you are doing simply by leaving the house or feeling these emotions, but active exposure should be a little more limited. For example, being alone and feeling ugly, the emotion will come, sit in it, but don’t let it get out of hand, and naturally it will subside. Your body needs to learn that these thoughts and feelings aren’t actually going to hurt you. Even if the pain manifests physically, There’s no lion chasing you. It takes time but there will definitely be better days ahead"

It can certainly be a factor to set you up for success.\n\nI have been diagnosed with ptsd and yes diet does definately affect how I feel, but it will not fix everything. Especially if your symptoms are so severe it is preventing you from leaving the house.\n\nIn short, yes, it is possible that you have trauma, but could also be very severe anxiety. I would also like to say that all trauma is valid no matter how trivial it may seem. This can even be trauma caused by the anxiety, like if you are having many panic attacks, you begin to fear having more panic attacks. That is a trauma response. Highly reccomend looking into DBT skills. There are groups and also just at-home resources (like workbooks) that can help you with regulating your emotions, coping strategies, etc."

Im recovering from a major knee surgery and injury which has greatly disrupted my schooling, social life etc. Past Issues with mental health but didn’t receive help. Recently reached put to headspace however I have to wait until april for any kind of support.\n\nFor a while now I have had difficulties with school, relationships and my social life due to anxiety and suspected neurodivergency. 6 months ago I had surgery to repair a sports injury to my knee which severely impacted my grades at school due to the lack of support offered from the school, turning me from an A/b to c and d student. As a result my confidence and self esteem has plummeted while my anxiety has gotten worse and is affecting my work and every day life. Ive lost interest in my favourite hobby and struggle to experience excitement or joy in the things I used to love.\n\nBecause of this (and past serious mental health issues) ive begged my parents for help for literal years for professional help but they have refused, believing that me talking to them would be sufficient support. It was only after I asked for professional help as my only wish for Christmas and my birthday did they believe me. Since then they have contacted headspace and I have done multiple assessments with them to gauge the type of help I need. But the soonest appointment for any support isnt until late April, leaving me with no options for help at the moment. The appointments are not regular either and have very long wait times in between due to amount of people they look at. I dont have anyone to talk to as i am not as close with my friends as i used to be. I cant speak to  my parents as they offer little in the way of support other than saying ‘ill never be happy if I continue to act like this’ or yelling at me For complaining.\n\n\nBecause of this I want to look at getting help on my own but I dont know how or where to go. If you have any advice on how I can look at support it would be greatly appreciated. ",

Coz one day when you become successful my friend, trust me your success will handle all that bullshit beautifully, all you gotta do is sit down wait until karma comes back and bite on their asses, you don't need to go to a place and introduce yourself coz your success gonna do that for you.  Because SUCCESS IS THE BEST REVENGE!!\n\n\"Just Keep Swimming!!\"\n\n- Dory -"

He will be 18 in a couple months. I am 16. \n\nAnd, he eventually started taking a dislike to me and we stopped talking because of some arguments, and he used to say “if you didnt have a uterus id kill you” and stuff like that. \n\nHe then violently attacked one of my friend and sent them for emergency surgery in hospital. \n\nWhen that happened, i stupidly posted a picture of his face on social media asking for people to let his family know his whereabouts.\n\nEver since then, he has harrassed me with calls, denying it was him, and joined a live i was on on social media and allegedly told people he “brutally raped” me because I left as soon as he joined, i dont know how he found my accounts on social media.\n\nthis all continued until i finally opened up to my family about the calls i had been recieving, as I had gotten one whilst out with my dad. \n\nAround this time, my friend had messaged me showing me screenshots of how he wanted to set me up to be beaten up, or worse. Sending direct messages to her. I love her to pieces but I can’t hang out with her anymore due to my own safety.\n\nSo, the only reason the calls and threats stopped is because I changed my number. \n\nI dreamt about him again last night sa’ing me and attacking me, and I’m just paranoid again.\n\nmy parents won’t let me go to the police. \n\ncan anyone help me? thanks. any words of advice are appreciated.\n\n",

Trust me this NOT the wise decision making age of yours. Reach out to someone who are genuinely concern about the situation who can give a solution to the situation, otherwise it's a waste of time. In any given situation BE STRONG. Don't show or post your emotions on social media since this man sounds like a psycho. DO NOT show weakness. He can use that against you. Check back your all the SM accounts carefully. If there's anything important that describes about you delete it immediately, Even it's a small post that describes how you feel on that day. Just delete all of 'em. Just some random pics if that make no sense keep it. But one at a random time. But make it quick. Don't let anyone feel like you are deleting your posts. Start from old ones to the recent. All of this is only if you want SM so bad. Otherwise I recommend to delete all your accounts at once. Remember details matter. Can be used against you. \n\nDo not respond to anything regarding this person. Basically think that you ghosted this person. People with this kind of mentality cannot be saved by a discussion. It's only fueling the fire. These kind of people crave for a reaction. Do not give that satisfaction. Silence is the best answer at this point. But make sure you are safe, even from so called friend of yours. So in that case you made right choice. Because she shouldn't have a conversation with this person in the first place to even begin with. Deadass should've blocked him from the very first text she got. Warn your friend also to stay away from this situation. Sometimes he might use her to get you.\n\nEven people who are close to you can be a snake that bites you from behind. Be observative. Don't trust things blindly just because it's a trustful person. Make sure that the situations are always truthful and confirmed. Trust your gut, your instincts. \n\nMove in the shadows. Get a Self -Defense class ASAP. One day you gonna need it."

It eventually got to the point where I wasn’t satisfied until the whole nail was pulled off.

I had a future once. Nowadays I'm just a husk. I had an episode a couple months back, seeing and hearing things, delusions, that sort of thing. I've come out of it, but I can feel it coming back. Last time I was terrified, I was panicking, with delusions playing into it. Now, I'm not scared. I am just watching it come with cold dead eyes. Last time it had something to take away from me, the little I had left. I fought against it for that. There isn't anything for it to take anymore. I hear people talking about getting better, but I don't believe them. I'm dead, you can't revive a corpse. And even if I wasn't, I don't know if I even want to get better anymore. Did I ever even have anything to begin with, except the empty promises of the life of one of these humans? Is it even possible to have something, fucking anything, to live for?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy brain is filled with fog and I hear muffled voices. For me that's stage 1 of its return. I begin to feel confused, and strange. Things start to feel off. I begin to get more and more detached. I feel cold. Very cold. It's dark. Very dark. My brain is thinking weirdly, I think. After so long, I don't know what brains are supposed to think like. Even when I was better for that month outside the psych ward I was largely detached. Depression doesn't just stop because a couple psychiatrists said it'll be okay for a bit. Am I even post-psychosis, because I'm starting to think I'm pre-psychosis. I was hospitalised for depression, they treated me for it, and they acted as if I wasn't even psychotic because I was good enough at hiding it. They never figured out that I thought there were demons in my room at the hospital and that I could feel and see them watching me. And in the end, all they did was give me an SSRI. I did not want to upend my life for an SSRI that hardly works. I'm likely to go off of it too, as all it has done is made me look fine from the outside, if you pretend the greys around my eyes aren't solid black.",

I'm 17, about to graduate high school, and it's only now that I've realized the toll my fixation on looks has taken on my life.\n\nAt 13, I started obsessing about my appearance. Four years later, I see how it consumed my life. I pushed people away, refused to leave my house, and told myself I'd start living \"once I lost some weight.\" At 5'2\" and 120 pounds, I wasn't at an unhealthy weight, but I began calorie counting obsessively. While I initially lost weight, I also lost friends, happiness, self-love, and felt miserable \n\nRecently, I stopped counting calories and gained the weight back, along with an uncontrollable food obsession. What did I accomplish in the end? Nothing. At 17, I'm friendless, housebound, deeply unhappy, and mourning the \"best years\" of my life I wasted on worrying about my appearance.\n\nI write this for anyone who might be starting down this path: it's not worth it. LIVE. Your teenage years should be filled with memories of friends, laughter, and love—not self-hatred. I just wish I would’ve realized this sooner.",

I should clarify I have very minimal romantic experience before this point.\n\nI felt like I liked him and like there was some chemistry before anything actually happened. Then we went on a date. When we arranged the date I was happy, he suggested it but I said I didn't want to ruin the friendship. I then phoned him up and asked if he wanted to go out maybe two weeks after this.\n\nDuring and now after the date it felt like I was constantly questioning him in my head - is he attractive enough? Am I attracted to him? Is he the right person for me? Do I really like him? \n\nThere is a specific trait of his that makes me question my attraction a lot but I don't want to say because it's so mean of me to think.\n\nThis really stressed me out but it's been continuing non stop since the date and I feel sick when I think about him now and I'm not sure whether it's due to anxiety or whether I am not into him.\n\nI've honestly thought about it so much and blown it out of proportion so much that I genuinely don't know what my true feelings are. I'm so anxious all the time. I would never want to lose him as a friend but it feels like there's so much pressure for it to work out now since I can't lose him in my life.\n\nI keep thinking like \"dating is more anxiety than it's worth\" but then I feel awful because I feel like if I truly liked him I wouldn't be thinking this way and that I would think it was worth it if he were the right person.\n\nWhat do I do??",

        "body": "I'm in college, and I've been talking to the counselors there about issues I'm having (they haven't diagnosed me with anything yet as it's very early in the process, but I think I have OCD). \n\nThe treatment the college has is meant to be short term, and if I want a regular, weekly therapy session, I need to go to a private practice (part of the reason for going to the school counseling center in the first place is getting help through this part, as it's confusing). \n\nThe thing is, I'm under my parents' insurance. They have a bit of an iffy mindset when it comes to mental health. They're not \"depression doesn't exist\" bad, but... they aren't far from that. I REALLY do not want to talk to them about my struggles, but if I want to use their insurance, they'll at least have to know.\n\nI'm not so sure about my dad. He's a middle aged conservative man, more or less fits the conservative stereotype honestly. He's always said I could talk to him about anything, but I'm not sure how that would work if I actually tested it.\n\nMy mom, I actually kind of know what to expect from her, because our side of the family has a history with mental health. Namely, my uncle, who was diagnosed with BPD and Schizophrenia a couple years ago after being in and out of mental hospitals for a couple years. On one hand, she has been physically supportive in bringing him to appointments/the hospital when needed, and let him stay a couple times when he was suicidal. But she really, really does not like doing it and does not at all understand it. I wouldn't really say she's emotionally supportive, basically. It took her forever just to accept the fact that he was mentally ill (she, along with the rest of my family, attributed his episodes to drinking and adderall, and took awhile to come around to admitting it. Some of them still quite won't).\n\nSo if her own child came out and said they wanted to start therapy... I'm worried how she would react to it. Plus, she's a gossiper. I heard every detail of my uncle's (admittedly basically public) issues. Even if I asked her to keep this private, I don't know if she could. Especially with her boyfriend, who basically doesn't believe depression exists, and I would have to deal with him. And I live with my mom, so if they react badly, I have to live with that.\n\nMy counselor said they can try to guide me through the process of talking to them, but I'm not sure how much it'll help...",

My mother also seems to be against the autism diagnosis, saying she does not see me behave as autistic people do. I just want some advice on how to handle this, should I ask my mother to step out? Do i mention the research I have done? This is a big step for me as I'm finally trying to get the right treatment for myself. Sorry if anything is not clear, I just returned from the hospital and a bit high off the meds.",

Well, anxiety is still a thing, but it's nothing, compared to those months when I was denying that I had panic attacks and just called myself dumb and told myself to stop seeking for attention in the middle of it.\nAnd finally I accepted myself and I'm happy now",

        "body": "As the title says, I compulsively punch things. And I say things to purposely exclude people, as apart from lighthearted teasing, I don’t have any sort of compulsion to hit people. Me punching things has nothing to do with anger, specific materials, etc. I also don’t look at things and have a voice in my head telling me to punch it. When im doing nothing, i often find myself “coming to” and im just punching a wall or something. Even when im not hitting stuff, i often like, shadow box walls or my girlfriend (again want to stress i DO NOT have the compulsion or want to hit her or anyone) . Just curious if anyone has any ideas why? People around me think its weird although they have kinda accepted it, but I cannot accept it without at least a theory of why. \n\nEdit - I guess its not necessarily a “compulsion” as I don’t feel the NEED to punch something, it’s more like my body just does it automatically and I either don’t realize or I have no control of it.",

I am in therapy and I have been a lot better, but rn life is stressful and as I said, I don't do well with that.\n\nI feel like she thinks that I am just a lazy person. Like I guess maybe but also I have depression and I know that I am not all that lazy when I am doing okay. It's just rare that I am. \n\nI want to make her understand but I think its pointless. She might see it as an excuse. I have been struggeling to keep up our cleaning schedule and Idk what to do.\n\nI don't think I will ever be like her. Maybe one could say that I have other strenghts, but I feel like she is simply op.\n\nHow are some people like that???\nThe only thing that I keep telling myself is that a) I have an illness, eventhough its invisible and that b) at least i am more compassionate than her.

Yet at least twice a week he will go into a rant about how he isn't feeling well that day and someone is \"chemically altering the way he feels\", I get so confused because I know it's impossible that this is happening.  He has even accused me in the past of drugging him, multiple times, and will say things like, \"its ok if you are, it doesnt even matter, just don't stop doing it\" (wtf??) ...I'm just so confused and concerned, that he has been saying these things over and over again. He was diagnosed with ptsd many years ago, but I dont think that has anything to do with this. Maybe it does? I have no clue. Someone please tell me if you have any advice on what to do, i have no idea how to help him calm down when he starts ranting. Its getting to the point where a whole weekend can be ruined, because hes in a bad mood, and If i ask him whats wrong his answer is almost always the same. That hes being \"chemically altered, and its not in his control\" and then the whole day goes to shit. I also want to add that in general he is a very loving husband. Hes so kind and patient. He makes me feel beautiful, and I know he truly loves me. He's like my best friend. But when he starts talking about being drugged, which has become more and more frequent, I feel like I'm going to lose my mind. Sorry if this post is all over the place..I'm just so stressed and worried about what's going on with him. Advice please? 🙏 feeling desperate. ",

I used to live in a world of denial, grasping onto any sense of intelligence but it’s not there anymore. I used to be an all A’s student, I graduated second in the whole grade. But now,  I will be lucky to graduate this year. I keep thinking back to how proud my parents were of me. They kept telling me that I will be such an independent person, how I am going to be so successful. Now I have piles of missing and late assignments. I can’t study or do any work. Trust me I want more than anything to be successful. To be in the top of my class again, to have people want to be like me. I used to daydream in class about how amazing of a life I will live when I am older, the car I will drive, how I will have so many friends. I was so excited to go to school, all I could think about during the summer was how many friends I will make. All the memories I would have to look back on when I was an adult. Just like in all of the movies. Now I don’t even see a future with me in it. Now I think about how I won’t even be able to work at McDonald’s. If I can manage to turn a 20 minute assignment into 4 hours how will I ever have a job? Provide for myself? Let alone a family. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I have spent my whole life doing a sport that I am not even good at. I am so bad at it in fact that my coaches don’t even think I am trying anymore. I am improving at such a slow pace that they think I would have to not try in the slightest to be as terrible as I am. Not even my teammates think I try. What they don’t know is how much I really do care. How every day at pratice I imagine being my teammates and having everyone look up to me. I am the worst person on my team. The kids who 11-12 years old are better than me. I have kind of just accepted that I will be bad at everything no matter what I do. I used to cry myself to sleep thinking about all of these things but I can’t even cry anymore. My teammates are one of the only people I have to opportunity to talk to. No one at school wants to talk to me, let alone work with me because of my grades. So I try to talk to my teammates but even they think I am insufferable. Trust me they do, they said it themselves. I just don’t know what to do. Somehow I always manage to do it wrong or make the wrong decision. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I guess I just want my parents to be proud of me and my accomplishments again. Don’t get me wrong, my parents are the best parents I could ask for. I just don’t have any thing for them to be proud of me for. My failing grades? Lack of social life and friends? Being the worst person on my team? Having no future? I would not be proud of me either.  It’s crazy how fast your life and future can go downhill.",

        "body": "So, I have been experiencing negative thoughts that didn’t serve my well-being for a long long time.  \n\nAnd from time to time I come up with some mental tricks, that can help me in my journey to fix this. \n\nAnd this trick did the following for me: it made me more aware of the thoughts that would weaken me and how. Hear me out. \n\nU know how in the real world we are bombarded with media that makes us dumb and insecure? \n\nBecause a weak and dumb society is one that is controlled easy by the people in charge. That’s why we know so little of what is really going on the world. \n\nSo for the “trick”:\n\nImagine your mind is a population. Some people have been living there a while and some are new, they just been born for a couple years, but EVERY SINGLE ONE of them is exposed (just like in the real world) to media. \n\nBut in this world, you are the man in charge. So it’s up to you to display what the people will see and hear. You may choose if you want to create a weak society or a resilient one. \n\nSo tell me: what would you for example put on the billboards when people are driving to their work? What would they read? What words would they consume? \n\nIn my case it would have read: you messed up your life or your too insecure or everyone is better than you. \n\nSo when I see that i’m like, I know this thought because I have it all the time. But the people in my mind, how am I making them feel with this?\n\nHow am I affecting my population? \n\nImagine all the people in your population driving to work and they see a message saying “your not worthy”\n\nNot only is it negative, but more importantly what tf is he/she supposed to do after reading that? That thought is so unproductive and causes only confusion. It also will never stimulate some form of real action, why would it? \n\nSo imagine how the media u deliver to the people in your head is affecting the population in a way that everyone is confused and doesn’t know what to do. \n\nTry this for a couple of days to reframe your brain to become more aware of the thoughts your feeding the population and to see that most of the time, it doesn’t lead nowhere. \n\nAnd when your aware of it, just tweak the thought just a little bit to make it slightly more productive. \n\nInstead of saying “your worthless” you can say “everybody has is own strengths, some just still have to find them” and let the population sit with that. It will be new for them. Let that feed their minds. \n\nThank you for reading. You are stronger than you think btw. ",

And I believe I have BPD, (Borderline Personality Disorder) or I am Bipolar. The intense mood swings,mainly caused from childhood/relationship trauma. The mood swings are caused by my incredibly sensitive emotions. I feel like I dont have control over my own voice, it doesnt matter how badly I want to stop talking. I physically and mentally cannot control myself. I have a huge fear of being abandoned and ending up alone. But when someone lies to me, I lose all emotion. I become mean and cold. I dont care who it is, im not going to be nice to them. (I want to clarify, it was never physically abusive from my end. I would never physically harm anyone). I feel insane because I cant control myself during these episodes. I also feel like writing these things down during episodes has been helping while I need to calm down. My body doesnt want me to stop because all I am doing is talking about myself. Doesnt matter what it is, as long as im writing about me.\n\n\nOne thing to know is, I know when people are lying to me. My “family” was a demon spawn of narcassistic hatred. I had to be okay with being lied to. So I got really good at reading their moods and emotions, and I knew when to stop talking. As to not have their rage taken out on me. My parents were not together while growing up, but continued to paint the worst image of eachother in my mind, by getting me to send their lies and rage towards eachother through me. Each story got worse and worse. To the point that when I knew they were lying about eachother, I would shut down emotionally and zone out until they were done talking.\n\n\nI was mainly living with my mom growing up, because my mom kept telling me my dad never wanted to see me. But when I would see my dad, he would always show how much he love and missed me by showering me with gifts. That was the “love” I got from him. Mainly video game things.\n\n\nVideo games have always been such a big part of my life, mainly because I was really good at most games I picked up. But also because I didnt have to think about the negativity that surrounded me. I was at peace.\n\n\nMy mom hated how much I played video games, so she would take the anger towards my dad for buying me video game things and project it onto me. By yelling and wanting me to tell my dad how she felt. \n\n\nAlso taking away consoles, or taking the wifi rouder to work with her. Basically making it so I had nothing while she was still angry with my dad. To the point I would go see my dad, because I knew I would get my feelings validated about my mom being an asshole. And it gave my mom the space she needed to calm down.\n\n\nOne of the worst parts about my childhood, was my full brother (one year older) physically and emotionally bullying me. I never knew why. But my parents didnt do anything about it. They wouldnt do or say anything to stop it. I am the youngest of 4 brothers. The two oldest brothers are half brothers, (Same mom, different dad) that lived with us until graduation. They were pretty much just living at the house, they are about 10 years older than me. They never really wanted me around at all, but that doesnt really matter. I dont have any trauma from them.\n\n\nAs well as my full brother (second youngest) and myself (youngest). I have always felt like I was not wanted in this family, I didnt fit in. The reason? I hated lying. I never wanted to do it because I know how it makes me feel, so I didnt want to make other people feel that way. But my family didnt care about any other person other than themselves. All individually, but my full brother and my dad would sometimes gang up on me. My dad has turned my brother into a mini version of him.\n\n\nI had to learn how to just go along with the lies. Because any confrontation about it will result in yelling, belittling, gaslighting or sometimes physical abuse from my parents and full brother. So anytime I am lied to, it sets me up for failure. I become incredibly docile and agree with things as to not create more conflict.\n\n\nRealizing I have been through this abuse, and finally understanding my feelings. I have learned about so many situations from my past when I shut down. People taking advantage of me because of how I react when it comes to being lied to. I used to think the feeling of anxiety was a mental thing. But I was recently informed that anxiety is a physical thing. So I had always thought to myself “My heart is racing, it must be an adrenaline rush!” Or “This is just what love feels like”. But It was anxiety. Crippling confrontational anxiety. And before I know it, im just stuck, in a depression, unable to climb back out.\n\n\nMy pregnant Ex-GF (f24), her parents (who she lives with) my full brother, and my parents all have been lying to me for the last 8 months of my life. My Ex-GF is pregnant, I was under the impression that the baby is mine. But today I was told that the baby wasnt mine. And that it was my full brothers kid. When my Ex-GF and I started dating, my brother was visiting from out of town. She cheated on me with him and got pregnant. Then lied to me throughout our whole relationship. \n\n\n\nAfter a passive aggressive “talk” with my girlfriend, I decided to take the time and ask her some questions that have always confused me when I had asked them. And to my suprise, those answers she gave were the same as the first time I asked in the past. And thats when I realized she was lying, and when I realized that she is a narcassist. That feeling of “love” was my anxiety spiking from childhood trauma. The look in her eyes, emotionless, and cold. She couldnt look at me, her tone of voice changed and started to try and blame me for asking the questions. I then asked the biggest question I could think of to see what happens. I asked “Do you know for certain that the baby is mine?” And then that set her off, she started getting angry. (I recognized the narcassism after so long of being ignorant of my feelings). \n\n\nShe started yelling anything and everything avoiding the truth of the question. Belittling me, blaming my psychotic parents for who I am today, telling me im crazy and Im making everything up in my head, but still couldnt answer the question. Then it got to the point of some physical abuse from her. Not enough to leave anything permanent, but enough for her to think it would get rid of me so she didnt have to answer the question. I then kept telling her that I know she is lying still, by the end of it her mom had shown up. She slipped up and admitted “she knew to a degree” about knowing the baby wasnt mine. Then immediately started lying for my Ex-GF to protect her so she didnt have to feel bad because shes pregnant.\n\n\nI have proof, videos I took when this was all happening.\n\n\nIm just so scared. Ive never felt so alone in my life.\n\n\nI hope this story makes sense to people. Im having doubts about how comprehensive this whole thing is. Ive gotten to the point of not being able to understand what is real and what isnt. ",

        "body": "Hello, coming here as a last-ish resort just for a new perspective into what may be going on with my sister. If anyone that is familiar with these symptoms or has been in a similar situation can help me understand I would be very grateful!\n\nShort background to our family dynamic, my sister and I have a pretty decent age gap of 10+ years but we’ve always had a close connection growing up. She moved out of the country when I was around 4-5 years old but I’ve never felt like that was an issue as she’d come visit a few times a year or I’d fly over. She’s gotten married with kids now and still lives abroad and we’ve become even closer on a more mature level now that I’ve gotten older.\n\nHowever, the past couple months have been really rocky for the entire family. My sister has been having these breakdowns where she constantly repeats herself for hours, constantly worries, creates issues in situations that aren’t there and has a “why me” mentality. The first time it happened with us was last year and the first time I’ve ever felt so torn and worn down in my life. We’ve seemingly solved the altercation since but I’m still going through it today. It’s hard to describe but the entire situation has left me baffled and although we have a fair share of incidents like these in the family (we’re a pretty big family), but never have I been so involved in one growing up. This one genuinely frightened me for months on end. \n\nI genuinely don’t think therapy is working for her. She’s been going for years but as of recent, we don’t see much improvement in this situation. I’m still young in the family so some things are kept from me but it’s inevitable that I hear the phone calls of her screaming and crying.\n\nWe’re really not sure what it can be, whether it’s PPD or something else. She’s been diagnosed with underlying medical issues since the beginning of the pandemic and we’ve had a pretty significant death in the family over 2 years ago. We desperately want to help her but it is difficult with the distance and the fact that she can’t see it herself.\n\nIf anybody knows what this can be or what we can do to help, I would be super grateful. I’m not asking for a professional diagnosis, just for a new perspective or if somebody has been through something similar before. Even if it’s just some slight insight!\n\n",

I am actually here to help people, write with strangers and it actually kinda helps myself to calm myself down. I actually see reddit as a comfort zone now for last months. Ive been very active, not only in the mental health sub. But back to you.\n\nI guess its a normal feeling in youre current sitiation and the place you are. You dont have to feel alone there, there are MANY Others that feel like that. I could tell you to focus on stuff you like to get a better feeling on stuff you do, to kinda get a bit of motivation back. Like drawing or making music, anything you like. Or maybe there was a hobby you had as a kid, but sadly gave up on it. Or maybe try something new? Like writing a novel or baking? \n\nI can recommend, cause i would guess you think a lot, do a little walk and listen to some music. I usually go alot on nightwalks that can go like over 5hours by just walking through the empty streets from the city i live in. Its calming down and helps me get my head empty. Sure my problems dont go away, but its defently a difference by thinking while walking than thinking in school/work. I got myself into reading again, now i read some novels while im at a park at night.\n\nDont look back on bad stuff that happend, like things you might feel miserable or your childhood or sm. Focus more on stuff you actually enjoy, try to make conversations. I know its hard. I cant even do that. And thats why i am here, to get my social status filled. I write more on reddit than i talk with people irl.\n\nI know, there are people, like me, out there that would be there for you, even when its just writing in a privat chat on reddit. Its even better when the other person is a stranger. My ears are all up for you."

I have to say not many people with a “serious illness”, like a neurodegenerative disorder that would cause tremors, develop them at age 14. The first thing that comes to mind is Parkinsons but that is exceedingly rare in young people, not impossible though. And as you report they only occur when stressed or nervous.  So in the first part of your post you mention you have developed a serious illness at age 14, but later report that neurologists and psychologists say there is nothing wrong with you.  Sounds like a stressed induced benign essential tremor. There is something you can do but there is no silver bullet for the tremor. It’s about managing your stress and anxiety.  I have a feeling you have been told this. "

It’s hard to distract myself from them. If I let them spiral for even a few seconds it becomes difficult to stop crying. \n\nI start doubting their existence, my existence, and reality when it gets really bad. \n\nI don’t want to talk anymore. I just want to hide from everyone and everything. \n\nIt gets so overwhelming and I want to talk about it with them, but I’m not sure if it’s okay or if it’ll be a mistake. Or it might make my anxiety even worse and I can’t afford that right now. \n\nI really like my team. They’ve been helpful, but it gets so stressful I find myself frozen in bed or on the floors spiraling for hours. I feel like I don’t have any human requirements to fulfill, so I just lay there. \n\nI only move for my pets, but I have cats and a senior dog that sleep for years.  \n\nThe idea of seeing them again stresses me out. I want to talk about it, but even when I think about it the anxiety starts choking me. \n\nI don’t know what to do. \n ",

I’ve been in the mental hospital before for attempts etc.. thankfully I got support and for the past year and a half I’ve been in recovery. Sadly around a month ago it started coming back really badly. I go to a private college preparatory school which normally requires 3-5 hours of homework a day on weekdays and most of the day on the weekend. Since the depression/anxiety came back I have absolutely no motivation to do anything. My psychiatrist said I shouldn’t go up on my antidepressant because I’ve been on the same dose for like 2 years and it was working well before. And my therapist didn’t really recommend anything either although she is reaching out to the school and reminded me of my coping skills. I’m so stressed out because I have a 6 page essay for humanities due next week and 3 test retakes tomorrow. (I’ve never even had to do test retakes until now- I can’t focus and I’ve gone from A’s to failing test  scores faster than you can blink lol)) does anyone have tips or advice for what to do? I’m really struggling especially with dissociation which is making it nearly impossible to focus or study at all. (Plus I feel like crying even thinking about what I have to do lol)  sorry if this is really confusing I’m writing this late at night while crying lol ",

        "body": "This started out weeks ago, early February. For months I had been battaling an intrusive thought that had become an obssesive thought. Every day it was the same cycle. Try to solve the feeling/thought like a rubic cube and have anxiety over it. My mental health was not good. For my whole life every so often there would come an intrusive thought that would cause me anxiety and or stress. Each one about a different topic. Back to a couple of weeks ago I suddenly felt different. The intrusive thought didn't bother me. I felt me but not me. I felt disconnected from my body and face as if they weren't mine. I almost felt like another person. And that's what I search up on Google. The first response was D.I.D. I didn't think much of it at the time and Depersonalization and Derealization also came up. But soon afterwards the D.I.D topic scared me, I was scared that I had it. My mind tried to convince me I had it. It felt like my brain was trying to split itself or myself in two just to give itself d.i.d I know now you can't forcefully give yourself D.I.D as well it's something that manifests in Childhood. Just thinking would cause this fear to go off fearing I might have d.i.d. (I've never had any traumatic thing happen to me as a kid and before searching d.i.d up on Google as well as the symptoms which is most likely where this whole thing started I've never shown any signs of it before.) My loved ones finally knocked some since into me and for like two weeks I was \"Free\" from this irrational fear. My brain made me think I was being torn apart. Recently I looked back on how did whole fear started and remembered how I felt. It scared me again and my brain tried to convince me if that fear again. I felt like I am a nobody. Like I'm permanently going to lose who I am. My brain at times is trying to convince me that I don't know these people or I don't remember this event because something to do with other personalities if I had one. I feel like I've broke my brain. Like this will lead to me breaking my brain. But I'm scared all this stress and all I've done to my brain is gonna make me lose myself. I've decided I'm gonna see a therapist but I don't really know what to tell them. Who I'm feeling. I wanna figure out what exactly is it that's going in inside my head before I make the appointment ",

I've always wanted my own job, room, house/apartment, etc. and just be a responsible adult, more intensely and realistically than I've noticed others in their early 20s. As I've gotten older, making decisions for my life as an adult makes me feel fulfilled in a lot of ways I didn't feel in high school. \n\nYet I have experienced a lot of disappointment and low self esteem in adulthood, both working and going back to college of my own volition. I haven't lived by myself yet, jumping from family and then my now fiance's family house--and I've always felt in a worse mood being in the house I stay in than going anywhere else. \n\nI might be longing for the greener grass as humans tend to do, but nothing I do changes how I am. I always come back to the thought of moving into my own place when I feel like I'm reaching my rope's end. Has anyone experienced a bettering of chronic depression or anxiety after living by themselves? It hypothetically seems opposite, but I've also always been an extreme introvert and anxious over a lot of physical things when sharing spaced with people.\n\nThanks in advance",

I’ve never had a friend show up for me when I needed them. I think I don’t really understand how humans are supposed to interact because I was very shy and didn’t have a lot of friends growing up and I get a lot of ideas about how friends are supposed to be from movies and shows. in those when someone has something happen like getting diagnosed with a rare neurological condition like I did friends kind of rally for them and the main character will have like a best friend that goes to her appointments with her and asks her how she’s doing and comes over to just watch movies and do more chill things. \n\nI kind of thought that would happen with my friends when I got sick but they kind of all just disappeared slowly and when I expressed that I was hurt by that they just never talked to me again.\n\nI felt kind of victimized by this but I saw a tiktok today that said this is covert narcissism. That covert narcs want friends to meet their needs and when they don’t they get upset and place themselves in the victim role. I don’t know if maybe I was just supposed to take it with more empathy for them and not express my feelings of wanting needs met. I don’t know though because i thought friends were supposed to be a support system. I try to be there for people and I’ve maybe put myself in dangerous situations being there for people before so maybe I don’t know where the boundary is supposed to be with that. I’ve always kind of been a person that will do anything for the people I care about, but now I am wondering if even that is just me being manipulative to get them to meet my needs later? Or maybe to put it not so evil maybe I want to people please so I don’t have to deal with things like my illness alone?\n\nI just feel like I am a really terrible person right now, though.\n\nDoes it mean I am a narcissist if I have expectations for how friends are supposed to be and I make that known? Is there a better way to navigate things if someone doesn’t meet a perceived need? Should I keep it to myself? I didn’t really have anyone else at the time, but maybe I could just talk to my mom more than trying to reach out to friends. I don’t know if maybe I just don’t know the proper way to navigate things and if isn’t normal to tell friends how you feel about that kind of thing. I just feel like I really deserve to be in the friendless situation I am in now that I saw that tiktok.",

It’s not an unhealthy expectation to want friends to be a support structure. That being said it is important to discuss boundaries with the people we have around us before expecting things from them.\n\nFrom what I’ve read you don’t seem narcissistic. (I’d highly suggest avoiding TikTok as a way to diagnose yourself {though I’m not sure if they have a verified doctor thing or whatever}) \nYou seem to want to reciprocate (very not narcissistic)\nYou seem aware of the needs of others(also very not narcissistic)\nYour also self analytical (your 3/3 not very much a narcissist but as I said grain of salt)\n\nIn all honesty it just sounds like you didn’t have great friends, but maybe professional help is what you need.\n\nI hope this helps\n\nMay you have hope and power\nGood evening."

I also found photos of me in Sydney which sounds plausible as i did travel there. i specifically remember that because I was 15 and my parents let me go alone which I was really excited about. but I have no memory of the photo as it was in the city. I never really went into the city. i took a train from the airport to central which is in the city but never left the the station and was only there to transfer to another train to go to my friend's house.\n\nand it's not like i was a baby or something this was when i was 15.

I constantly compliment them, hug them, say I love them, gift them gifts no matter the equation, pay for things without expecting anything back etc. but I feel like everyone takes my kindness for granted.

        "body": "I have extreme atypical OCD, along with other unspecified mental illness because of its complexity and severity. I had a moment 3 years ago where I had a breakthrough and felt ready to beat it, and then a 1 in a trillion trigger happened. I lost my mind, girlfriend, car, apartment, and job. I developed psychogenic seizures, began fainting, and utterly lost my mind and would obsessively call friends or eventually anyone to grieve what I had lost and obsess about the trigger. I almost attempted suicide twice. Within the past 3 years, I attended 4 different residential treatment programs (along with about a dozen hospitalizations), but eventually ended in a psychiatric hospital in Maryland (I am from Florida).\n\nI finally felt at this hospital after the inhumane terror of the past three years that I had a chance to turn it around before I left. I had a plan to get home, rehabilitate myself physically, and step back into life and get back everything I had, including the girl I love, and then finally chase my dreams without this stopping me.\n\nI just got out, and, the day before leaving, experienced *another* extremely unlikely and earth shattering trigger, and now I now have returned to my hometown. I am becoming extremely suicidal again, even though I promised myself I would not go home until I was better, but did not have a choice. Now, instead of returning and beginning my journey of having won and living and getting everything back and more, I cannot stand to even exist in my city, and everything that *should* make me happy, like a great new apartment, a fresh start, having FREEDOM after being locked up for a year, etc, is **torturing** me, because all I am able to experience is this sort of moment by moment grief that it’s ruined now and I cannot appreciate it or be/express myself, which is the crux of my entire disorder.\n\nI now have this whole plan in my head of what I would be doing, but I cannot do it, and it is almost literally killing me. I also have some very important deadlines I need to meet in May, which would’ve been certainly possible if I could’ve carried out this plan but not if I stay stuck in this state. I truly believe I needed to turn it around before I left the hospital in Maryland and that if I didn’t I’d be fucked. Whenever something would “go wrong” there, I’d wake up and take another day to keep going and try to turn it around, but now I’ve already left! I considered just trying to follow the plan I had and “fake it” but between my issues with executive functioning I had while I was sick and the inability to “fake” things like my personality when I see friends again, love for this girl, being better in general etc, I genuinely don’t know what to do. I guess I could try to go back to Maryland and re-do it, but it’s doubtful that’s a possibility, and even then I’d probably just be thinking about how it would’ve just worked out if I had been able to leave on a good note without this trigger and leaving would’ve been the best day I could imagine to finally be free and go live.\n\nAnd before anyone mentions medicine or therapy, I have tried about 40 pharmaceuticals including multiple from each class, psychedelics, supplements, alternative medicines, and ECT; along with just about every type of therapy including CBT, DBT, ERP, ACT, NLP, psychodynamic therapy, group therapy, family therapy, trauma therapy, mindfulness, meditation, and manifestation; along with dozens of physical interventions/exercise, even including brain scans, sleep studies, acupuncture, and much more.\n\nI truly believe if I this trigger didn’t happen I could’ve pulled it off, and I don’t know what to do now.",

I am from the UK and I do have GCSEs, but when it was time to sit my A-Levels, I had a 3 hour meltdown where ultimately a decision was made to pull me out of school. I say meltdown because although I haven’t been diagnosed with autism— I just know it was that because of the way it unfolded and left me nonverbal for a couple of hours. What lead me to this meltdown was because I couldn’t study for my exams, since I also have ADHD (this I am on an NHS waiting list for). \n\nBut this isn’t the main thing that hurts.\n\nDuring this period I was suffering a deep depression where I was highly suicidal. I had just moved from the city to an extremely rural area with my parents (mum and stepdad). I can’t drive and the public transport is next to none. All my ‘friends’ were in the city and were taking their A-Levels, and I was not. \n\nHowever, I still went to the school prom at the end of the school year. I had fun. But by the end, I started opening up to a classmate about the s*xual assault I had received from my stepdad. A couple of days I ended up with his number and opened up to him more, to which he encouraged me to open up to my ‘friends’. So I created a group chat and shared my feelings and experiences with my ‘friends’, including the fact that I was suicidal. They all sent me kind messages at the time.\n\nThen I had a mental breakdown and left all my group chats, only one ‘friend’ messaged me to see if I was okay. But overtime, everyone had come to abandon me so I deleted the messaging app as seeing that people were online and weren’t bothering to check up on me or invite me to hang out or anything in general really affected me. No one even messaged me when it was my birthday.\n\nBut that was some time ago now.\n\nToday, I am still living with my parents which has been turbulent since they are not accommodating for neurodivergent people at all. In fact are actively harmful to me by deliberately ignoring my boundaries even after I have made them very clear and even going as far as making me into the problem for having said boundaries.\n\nI have been job searching since July and yet I can’t seem to get a job. I was rejected by Tescos 5 times which makes me feel terrible because I feel that I am not even qualified for even the most basic jobs. Many of the job interviews, I missed out on was because my phone anxiety was so bad I couldn’t even answer the phone or call back and after the job interviews I did attend, I had a panic attack or meltdown after every one.\n\nI am also on universal credit but they haven’t been helping at all with my job search nor helping me move out from my parents house despite pleading with them for some sort of help.\n\nI am so lost right now. Luckily I am not suicidal anymore but the failure and loneliness is chipping away at my will. I spend my days consuming content, fantasising about and watching Bungou Stray Dogs (an anime/manga/light novel which is my current hyper fixation/special interest).\n\nI need some direction so I’m hoping that maybe I can get some ideas, similar stories, anything that could possibly help me.",

I never had a grandfather growing up, and my dads mom I only meet five times in my entire life because she is “too good” to meet up, so my grandma d on my moms side is my only grandparent I have truly known. She is almost 80, and I constantly think that every call I have could be the very last time we talk. We live in different states, so I try to call her a few times a week because she lives alone in the middle of nowhere but also because I know she doesn’t have many more years and being she is my only grandparent I value the relationship between us. My grandma has never complained by the amount of times I call, she actually seems to be pleasantly surprised when I call and enjoys our talks, but recently I’ve had a few men (I’m gay) tell me they can’t date me because I talk too much to my grandma and mom. Am I calling too much? It just scares me that one day I’ll decide not to call and she’ll die and I’ll spend the rest of my life wishing I had called, yet any time I date another guy the other guy calls me a loser ect.. \n",

        "body": "For context, I am a 19 year old woman who still lives at home with parents. These past two years, my life has fallen apart, and I am struggle to find the motivation to improve myself. During my senior year of high school, my best friend and I grew apart after doing our junior year online due to Covid. It sucked because they were my only friend and without them, I was alone. On top of that, I was struggling to stay motivated in school and was stressed out a lot.\n\nFast forward to freshman year of college, things were going fine initially. I was doing fine in my classes, but struggled to make friends. Then, the coursework ended up multiplying and it lead to me having a mental breakdown and then taking a leave of absence. I also had the same outcome back in the Fall of 2023. Ultimately, I dropped out of college because I figured out it wasn’t for me.\n\nThus, now I am trying to figure my life out. I have been working at a family business for the past two years but hate it. I only took the job because I wanted to figure out what other options I had. I did find a career path that I am interested in, which involves animals. However, I still continue to suffer from depression and feel like a waste of space.\n\nLately, I have been reminiscing about high school, and my old friendship. I used to be a promising student and had a small social circle. However, I have fallen so far since and am a failure. I have failed my family as a daughter and feel like an embarrassment. I have always had trouble making friends and feel unworthy. On top of that, I made a big mistake yesterday while driving that is killing me. For me, driving is a way to establish independence, but I feel like such an idiot. \n\nToday, I had bad anxiety thinking about what could come of my mistake, as I am unsure if I would receive a ticket or not. During my anxiety attack, my parents told me that I stress them out, and they’re right. I am a huge burden to everyone around me and sometimes, I feel like they would be better off without me. I have dealt with severe mental health issues since middle school, and they have faced more challenges with me. My brother also had his own struggles, but nothing compared to me. He is successful, has plans for his life, a girlfriend, and happiness. I feel like the defective child. Honestly, the thought of suicide just crosses my mind sometimes. I hate that I exist. I hate how worthless I am. I just want to disappear, so my family can be happy without. I have no one else, so no one would miss me.",

        "body": "I've sorta interrupted my treatment for 2 or 3 months and I was actually feeling better, now I've  resumed and things are so awful. I cannot get up from bed, not even play videogames. I'm overwhelmed by negative thoughts and emotions, and I can't think. \nMy therapist sent me a questionnaire and I couldn't answer one basic question with a no. from 1 to 6\nI don't feel confident in driving anymore cause my head and vision is all foggy\nI think it's time to quit doing meds\n\nI've started going to psychiatrists since 2018/2019 due to having a panic attack while on weed, I was having convulsions and couldn't really speak. The convulsions kept repeating for a few months or so, probably when experiencing intense emotions like sadness or fear. It's possible weed also triggered a psychosis. I didn't manage to follow treatments and kept smoking weed or drink alcohol. So I kept getting such episodes, but without the convulsions. Only that they were more frequent and more intense. I also suffer from severe depression and some personality disorder (i kept asking, but wasn't told what) i changed doctors a few times, starting treatments in every episode. Medication proved to be effective during my psychosis and while I was recovering, maybe I'm wrong and it was just time passing by, and I was just imagined they actually help and keeping me stable.\nTwo years ago, I had my last episode and meanwhile my brother committed suicide and found out my girlfriend has been cheating me with everybody for 3 years. 1 year after I managed to quit weed, but I've never been the same after that episode began. Since then I feel like I can't think, speak, feel or remember anything,  even tho' nobody really belives me and I get that, but I can't even remember my brother, I didn't cry or even care while he suffered such a miserable, slow and painful death. \nNeither medication nor therapy ever worked and I lost all hope by now. My life has been such a nightmare and I wish I had what it takes to end it. \nThings just worse and worse and I can't accomplish the most simple tasks. All I've done since my first breakdown was play videogames. My parents take care of me, but they're very old and suffer from dementia. It's just a matter of time until everything falls apart\n\nI started this post wanting to say I'll quit my treatment and turned into completely something else 🤷‍♂️",

He smiled less and we talked less. 1 morning i woke up to see a missed call. I never saw him again. One of his friends reached out to me a couple of days later and told me what happened. We had occasionally talked and he knew I was close with Sam. That's the story of how I killed my friend. He was the only real friend I had and he killed himself. I wasn't there for him. I killed him. On the night he committed he called me. I was asleep. I could've saved him. I didn't. I killed him",

He may have just been calling to say goodbye, and probably wouldn’t have listened to anything you said. He had his demons and those are not yours to fix, they were his. I know how much it hurts, but you cannot blame yourself like this. To vaguely quote Dr. Cox on scrubs, “the minute you start blaming yourself for someone’s death, there’s no coming back.” You can’t do that to yourself, I promise you he wouldn’t want that for you. Write down your memories of him, keep them, remember him. That’s the best you can do, he would not want you or anyone blaming themselves. I say this as someone who had attempted many times in the past, and almost succeeded once. All I could think was, I hope my brothers and dad don’t blame themselves. Please be kind to yourself, take care of yourself and just keep those memories with him safe and let them bring you a bit of light when you think of him, not darkness. I’m so sorry you went through that."

I’m really sorry for your loss and I know it’s hard because I would probably feel the same way, but thinking rationally you were rightfully sleeping, you could not have done anything more for him. Even if you were awake and talked to him, it was his choice. \nI’m gonna repeat something that I read in a previous comment, you (we) are not powerful enough to save someone from an heart attack, from mental illness and from suicide. It’s probably a really harsh way of thinking but at least it takes away all the responsibility and a big weight from our shoulders.\nI know it’s hard but please be strong!!"

        "body": "Sweetheart, I'm going to say something that may sound mean, but it's really not.  You are not powerful enough to cause a heart attack and a suicide. No one is.   You may have had a feeling about your Grandfather because you could 'see' he was feeling different, those small differences that are almost imperceptible that just tugs at you but you can't pin point ?  It may be that your power of observation saw something that was different.... Idk know your Grandfather and I'm not a Doctor, but even if you had taken him to the hospital that moment they may not have been able to tell and may not have been able to stop it, or save him when it did happen.... There are different types of heart attacks, and some are just too severe to come back from.\n\nWith your friend, you say that you would have been able to save them, but, again this may sound mean, but it's not really.... You may not have been able to... You may not have noticed, he may have chosen to hide it from you, he certainly knew how much you cared, and he didn't suicide because you didn't answer the phone, even if he suicided that night, its likely he had decided long before that, and the fact that he decided means it was his decision and he would have done it regardless.  And although again, this may sound mean, but it's really for you that I say this, he may have been relieved that you didn't answer so that he didn't have to lie to you and tell you he was okay, and he didn't have to try to say goodbye without you knowing what he was doing .... Because he certainly sounds like he cared as much about you as you do about him.  People do save each other some time, but that doesn't mean that people are always able to save each other, and it's not anyone's fault when it doesn't work out.  This world and mental health issues are tough, as you know.   \n\nSo, there's a sub for everything and there are  subs for all mental health issues, subs for social anxiety,  there cool subs 'explainitlikeimscared for when you need step by step instructions to do something, there's grief subs to help with loss, there's dadforaminute and subs about every subject known to man, so if you have a favorite or a hobby, there's subs for it, there funny subs and weird subs and there are soooooo many cat subs there is a sub that lists the cats subs.....  So although you may not have friends where you are right now, there are a half million subs and people all over the place, so I'm hoping you'll be able to find a bunch of subs that help you to deal with everything, and enjoy stuff, and hopefully find a group that fits you.  I am all over the place, and I'm not structured enough to guarantee that I'd be reliable, but if you don't hate me for saying all this stuff you can find me in whatever sub I'm in, I had to stop the chat stuff due to an issue, but if you search anyone's username you'll be able to find them.  Be safe."

        "body": "Hey, I’m a 15 year old male. This all started in October. It was like a week before Halloween and this girl I’ve liked for years atp has been talking to me. I think things are going great until I found out she’s been leading me on this entire time. This made me not eat for 2 days. After this I still wanted to talk to her. So I ended up becoming just friends with her. Ever since then it’s been hell walking through school and seeing her. After this about a month later, my grandma (who was like a second mother to me.) passed away due to cancer in many different places of her body. I still remember all the details. I just got done with the first day of our second trimester. My aunt and uncle picked me up (which was strange considering they had never picked me up.) they tell me that my parents are at my grandmas house and that I’m going to see her because she wasn’t doing well atp. We get there and I see my dad and uncle there. They both told me to go in there and say my goodbyes. I walk in and talk to her (she was pretty much dead, her hands felt like wax, they were cold) as I was saying goodbye, she started choking on her saliva and ended up passing away in my hands. After a couple of hours had passed, I saw her get taken out of the house in a body bag. This was the first time I had cried since 2018. The next week I missed school everyday. The funeral was the Monday after her passing and I also cried then. It was a very difficult week. Because of my absence from school my grades started to slip. My parents prioritize my grades over everything else. (Faith, friends, hobbies, etc. btw I love my parents and I’d never change anything about them) so I was overly stressed from everything. Luckily Christmas break was coming up. The first day of Christmas break a girl that I also kind of liked added me on snap. We started talking and we had a lot in common. We both liked the same stuff, we both valued family, all that stuff. I’m not gonna get into any specifics but I genuinely started to love her. She had told me what she’s been through in life.  But anyways, she stopped talking to me because she started to like my best friend. (Luckily I have amazing friends that wouldn’t hurt me like that ever) that cut deep down into me. Ever since it’s been hard to focus on what I like, my grades have been slipping, I haven’t been able to talk with my friends as much because of school. I just need help processing what to do next. Thanks for any help. ",

But what I recommend is take a moment, even ten minutes a day and think about what YOU like, not in people but in yourself, for example ten minutes a day I look in the mirror and ask myself what I like. I usually say the same stuff over and over (motorcycles and my stubbornness) but for someone trying to figure out stuff it can help, write down some things you think of that you might like. And I know how relationships are in these times. Don’t completely avoid them but focus less on relationships. You’re 15, you have literally 40+ years to find that special someone. Even if it is a long time you will. Stay strong brother. Keep pushing and don’t stop even if the bag is 500 tons heavy. Wish you the best."

        "body": "In a world where screens and electronics dominate, the question of whether technology is good or bad for our mental health is urgent. Let's break down the digital labyrinth and unravel the impact that our gadgets have on our mental wellbeing.\r  \n\r  \nThe Digital Divide\r  \nTechnology has bridged gaps and connected people globally, but it has also triggered a digital divide. Socioeconomic differences in access to technology may give rise to feelings of exclusion and exacerbate mental health issues for those on the wrong side of the divide.\r  \n\r  \nSocial Media's Double-Edged Sword\r  \nSocial media platforms have transformed communication, yet they come with their own set of challenges. On one hand, they provide a sense of connection; on the other, they can foster feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and loneliness through constant comparison.\r  \n\r  \nWork-Life Balance in the Digital Age\r  \nWhile technology enables remote work and flexibility, it blurs the lines between professional and personal lives. Maintaining a harmonious work-life balance becomes crucial to prevent burnout and safeguard mental health.\r  \n\r  \nInformation Overload \r  \nThe constant influx of information can exhaust our cognitive capacities. It takes mental effort to sort through so much data, which can cause stress and fatigue.\r  \n\r  \nScreen Time and Sleep Patterns\r  \nExcessive screen time, especially before bedtime, can disrupt sleep patterns. The blue light that is generated by screens disrupts melatonin production, affecting sleep quality and, as a result, mental health.\r  \n\r  \nTechnological Solutions for Mental Health\r  \nAt the same time, technology offers various tools and applications designed to support mental health. From meditation apps to online therapy platforms, these resources provide accessible avenues for seeking help and building resilience.\r  \n\r  \nTo sum it up, the impact of technology on mental wellbeing is complex and multifaceted. As we maneuver the digital landscape, it's crucial to strike a balance, leveraging the benefits while mitigating potential harms. Engaging in open conversations, sharing experiences, and staying informed can empower us to harness technology for positive mental health outcomes.\r  \n",

These symptoms seem to be the standard things for people who experienced childhood trauma, and I experience every single one to a tee. Every symptom that I see people talking about is something I heavily relate to and have felt for my whole life. (Except for sexual abuse stuff).\n\nI am starting to think I have been blocking out memories. I have very, very few memories of my childhood. Just things like when my mom took me to Disneyland or when I went camping with my dad. However, there is one memory I have that the more I think about it the more I feel like there is a lot more under the surface. The memory is of my dad \"playfully\" pinning my arms behind my back when I was 7 or 8. I feel like he used to do that all the time, but I don't remember. I cried until he stopped, at which point I ran into my room to escape him. He ran after me and pinned me to my bed, he was getting angry. He is a big 6'1 200 pounds of muscle guy fueled by endless testosterone, so I remember being terrified when he came after me. (I am still uncomfortable around him pretty much always, I think this might be why). Anyways, he had my arms behind my back and was sitting on my legs, both of which hurt like hell. I continued crying and trying pointlessly to escape. I then said something like \"if i cant fight you with my body, ill at least fight you with my words\" and then he laughed and said \"nobody has beaten me with their words in 20 years.\" That last bit might be from a different, similar memory, but I remember that exchange very clearly.\n\nThe more I think about this the more concerned I get. I have the feeling that this was a common occurrence. My mom also told me that I used to beg her not to make me go to my dad's house, to the point of sobbing at her feet and screaming when she put me in the car. My dad is kind of an asshole most of the time as of late, but he hasn't hurt me in years. He still has violent outbursts, we just finished patching the wall where he threw a rubber spatula so hard it dented a stud in the wall. (He spilled mac and cheese and lost his shit). But he also absolutely loves me and I am his greatest treasure in the world. He literally told me his entire purpose in life was to have me. So I am incredibly conflicted. I don't know how to feel about any of this, I am just depressed and anxious as fuck all the time and I think it might be trauma but I don't know. \n\nI know subreddits aren't meant for diagnosing (and thats not what im asking for) but I am not really able to go anywhere else for help (I have a therapist and I have asked for her help with this but she didn't really do anything for me). I would just like for some people to say if my suspicions might be right. I have the symptoms of childhood trauma but not really memories to tie them to except for this one foggy memory. I am confused. ",

So while there was only one specific confrontation that you’ve listed there might be other times where he’s used your fear or other emotions to control/manipulate you. The reason there would be no memories directly tied to this is because of how subtle it can be.\n\n(An example would be like how my father would use ambiguous language to create veiled threats if we didn’t do as he wanted.)\n\nI hope this helped.\nMay you have power and hope."

        "body": "Hi! this might be longer\n\nI'm 18, going on 19 and all my life has been pretty much easy and good. I've grown up in a middle class family but I had everything I needed - stable family (though my mom divorced my dad when I was 2 and I never got close with him - but I've never ever cared much about this fact), I grew up being close with my cousin who was like my sister, I had nan and grandad and loved my mum and she loved me. I'm telling you all this because I genuinely don't believe that I ought to have a childhood trauma. or - I don't know where it should come from if I come from such good family conditions. \nI've always been a disciplined kid, played by myself for all my childhood, would never throw tantrums and never caused any problems. like at all. i seemed to be very aware of myself since the early days. \nwhen I was 9 I started struggling really hard with anxiety and panic attacks. my mum would try to help me but we pretty much kept it a secret because she was scared/ashamed of it, maybe? \nbut she was always kind. \nI got in therapy when I was 10 but struggled real bad until I was like 12. I felt like nobody really understood me. I got better and then worse again at 13, struggling with depression too. I got better again and went through my teenage years feeling somehow,, regulated. \nbut that's when I realised that I actually hated myself in an extreme way. I wouldn't hurt myself but I knew there was something in me that didn't approve of my true self. \nI having a slight mental health relapse these days, nothing I wouldn't be able to cope with, but I realise it's getting way harder to look in the mirror. cuz I know that there's this person that I seriously don't like, like I literally can't look myself in the eyes, that's how much I hate myself. I feel like I shouldn't be saying this because I manifest bad things, I'm grateful for my health and for my life but there's just this thing that I cannot shrug off. I don't like how my body looks but that's not even the worst part, I just hate everything I do, everything I think and I would beat myself up if I had the chance. \nI feel like there's this huge cloud of anger somewhere deep in myself that needs to get out but I don't know how to let it. I don't want to be aggressive. I'm after all still a disciplined child. I just feel so angry all the time. \n\nTLDR: even though I've been lucky in life and got out of my mental health issues pretty well, I have this overwhelming anger somewhere deep inside of me and I don't know where it comes from - maybe from the fact that I hate myself so much that I struggle to look in the mirror?

I hate being seen as weaker then men and I hate that whenever I have kids I'll only be seen as a mother and it's the only thing they will think about whenever they see me. I hate that my husband is probably gonna be a lazy asshole because he's gonna play dumb and say \"I can't do it right like you\" and I hate that my husband will have a personality to other people and I won't. Why me? Why am I a girl. I hate it. I don't wanna be a girl. I don't wanna do this anymore it causes sm pain. Idk I'm a feminist but everyone makes fun of me for it because of how we are portrayed and how I have my own beliefs on gender norms and equality ig\nI'm not one of those feminists that hate men. This is just me vent",

        "body": "to start, idk if ive had any mental problems or illnesses throughout my life. My mother would always bring around other men to the house when my sister and me were home from a young age, im pretty sure she has something wrong mentally. She has hit me im pretty sure purposely twice in my seven years living with her and tried to abandon me three times. When i was 1-3 i was constantly being thrown in between my mothers and my fathers homes until they figured something out for me and my sisters wellbeing. A lot of what i thought was real love as a child turned out to be fake love just to show the men she would bring around to make it look like she was a good mother. She left one day when i was 7 years old to take care of my 20ish years old drug addicted brother in mexico with no papers aka no way back. This left me in what i assume was depression(not really sure havent ever been to a clinic for my mental health) I would cry every day for about 4 or maybe more months. After this i went and started 4th grade and it was just troublesome for me, i was constantly fighting with people over really anything that remotely made me angry. skipping a few troubled years in 6th i took up smoking and drinking, not addicted but i would get high 2-3 days a week and got drunk every other week. This was a consistent cycle till mid 7th grade.(note i always had trouble staying in school after my mother left). starting eight grade i was more calm about smoking and never drank because i had moved in with my older sister because my dad took a job seven hours away from home. There i stayed for two years with maybe five visits from my dad during the whole thing, during that time period i feel i became really close with my brother in law and really felt that he told me more about life in those two years living with him than my dad ever has. Its been about a year and a half since i moved out, he had stage four cancer two years prior to me moving in with them. After moving out he became significantly weaker and lost a lot of weight. He passed in august of 2023. This took a toll on everyone that knew him, My sister was with him since 2011 and i knew him since i was three years old. This made me really sad(dont know if i was depressed). I dropped out of ninth grade twice now and stay home and clean for the most part while my dad works, as soon as i turn 16 i will start working and helping pay bills. People around me always would ask if i had add or adhd, i dont know and i really think i dont. People i know more personally always said i have anger issues. My older sister lives with me now and it really ticks me off how she shows off her new boyfriend(i can make a thread about her and her boyfriends relationship and how i think its a disrespectful and a disgusting relationship more on my sisters side) I have constantly found myself cutting my arms where you cant see when i have a shirt on, i dont know why i do this but i usually do it after i get in my thoughts. These thoughts which im confused about are mostly just me crying in the bathroom quietly while pretending to shower thinking about what would happen when i die or how it would feel if i cut my wrists instead of my shoulders. I dont know if this is my curiosity or me having no suicidal thoughts. This happens 2-3 times every month for the last three or four months. If  there are any questions im completely open to answering questions about everything and everything.",

        "body": "I'd like to just dump my problems that have been festering around me since COVID-19. During 2020, when my family was forced to be all together and this caused all kinds of problems that added onto my social anxiety. I became unadapted to the world, isolated myself, and withdrew from everything and everyone. My family offered no support and I felt like I became the scapegoat. The next year, my dad died, went out like a clown, not taking his own life seriously while he destroyed everything about the family.\n\n2022 I isolated myself the most and did what I could to escape from the world. In 2023, I went into the dorms but had a mental breakdown, went back home and tried to go out and do a few things but still remained stuck in my mental health problems. I had another breakdown at home, moved into the dorms to escape it all again between 2023 and 2024, but eventually the stress got to me again and made a careless mistake (not as destructive or much of an outbreak as before at least).\n\nI have a problem of talking to myself without really thinking about it, sometimes it's seriously talking to myself about my life and stuff. Other times, it can be random nonsense that looks like insanity and that I've lost my mind to other people. I personally think this is due to social isolation, for a long time I avoid making any contact with other people and still do what I can to isolate myself. I know that I won't be able to last much longer like this, but I feel as if I have no stability anywhere in life.\n\nI believe that i can hear people whispering about me wherever I go, that I'm constantly being talked about wherever I go, and that I'm being watched and judged by other people. Sometimes it's true, because I do end up disturbing other people by talking to myself or doing odd things, but at times it's obviously all made up and not real.\n\nI lost my job (or rather, I decided to quit because I was already planning to and felt stressed that I was still working there and slipped up) because I just started dropping a profanity that was randomly swimming up in my mind from a song. Now, I have absolutely nothing against race, gender, sexuality, and what not, but I ended up saying a racial profanity from a song that was stuck in my head and whispered to myself which others heard.\n\nI feel bad that I may ruin other people's days or even weeks for awhile because of that, but overall I meant absolutely no ill will about it. I just feel like I have no stability, support, or anyone to care for me. I have nothing that other people have had such as a car, family life, a well-kept house, some financial support, and a caring family. \n\nI think having my own place and finding a way to participate socially would help... but I wonder if that will fully solve my problems so they don't happen again.",

        "body": "It sounds like you’ve been navigating through an incredibly tough period, marked by loss, isolation, and challenges that have deeply impacted your mental health. The feelings and experiences you’re sharing are significant, and I want to acknowledge the strength it takes to open up about them. It’s clear that the past few years have compounded a lot of stress and anxiety for you, influencing your behavior and thoughts in ways that feel out of your control.\n\nRegarding talking to yourself and feeling like others are whispering about you, these experiences can indeed stem from intense social isolation and anxiety. It’s a coping mechanism for some, a way to process thoughts or simply the result of feeling disconnected from social interactions. However, when these thoughts turn into beliefs of being watched or judged, it’s important to tackle them head-on because they can amplify feelings of anxiety and isolation.\n\nFinding stability and support is crucial. You’re insightful to recognize that having your own space and seeking ways to engage socially could be beneficial steps. While these changes might not solve everything, they can significantly impact your mental health by providing a sense of control and belonging.\n\nBuilding a support network could also be key. This might include reconnecting with any supportive family members or friends, finding community activities that feel safe and inviting, or seeking professional support through therapy or support groups, especially ones focused on managing anxiety and social skills.\n\nTherapy could also offer you tailored strategies to cope with and gradually reduce the behaviors and thoughts that are troubling you. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, in particular, is effective for addressing social anxiety, helping to challenge and change unhelpful thought patterns, and encouraging gradual, supported exposure to social situations.\n\nRemember, recovery and finding stability is a journey that involves small steps. It’s okay to start slow, acknowledge your progress, and be kind to yourself along the way."

I am introverted/closed, have a lot of general and social anxiety, and suffer from a lack of intimate relationships which I believe all 3 were caused by the parentification. \n\nOn a good note, My siblings and I live together, our parents recovered and we have a stable life.\n\nI have heard of people trying therapies out or getting anxiety diagnosed and treated but have no clue where to start with either of those options. if any of you have dealt with this or have advice on this matter, I would love to hear it and apply it.

        "body": "I really hate being alive. And I think that’s okay. I don’t understand why people make such a big deal about wanting to die or me being suicidal as if there aren’t 100 other ways to die that are super horrific in life that you can’t even control. I’m not ungrateful about my life. I love my friends. I love my girlfriend. But I think I should have the right to take my own life if I’m living in perpetually generated trauma I didn’t ask for. On top of that the guilt of perpetuating my trauma just adds to the cocktail of triggers and mental illnesses I have. This is not a plane of existence I want to be in. When I tell people this they try to give me advice based off what their life is like and not based off the trauma I’ve faced and not only is that insulting but it’s patronizing. I hate the whole fake positivity shit. People think cause I’m mentally ill and suicidal that they have to talk to me like a crying baby. I wish my friends and family would just accept the fact that suicide is a possibility in my future. It’s literally just death. None of us wana see anyone die but the fact of the matter is that we’re all gonna die so why is there such a negative connotation about suicide when it’s literally a chosen death. I can choose not to feel pain. I can choose to feel pain. I can overdose and die peacefully or more peaceful than getting hit by a fucking truck. Or getting cancer. Or getting dementia. And the saddest part of all this is how selfish everyone is about my perspective as if my body is theirs. As if I have to continue living so they don’t have to go through pain. It’s absurdly insulting. I’m not asking anyone to be happy about it. I’m asking everyone to leave me tf alone. I’m tired of managing it. I want a CURE and I don’t care how unrealistic that sounds. Everyone wants to help so bad but no one is willing to go get a fucking PHD in fields that could advantageously help or cure the mentally ill. People only want to help when it’s convenient not when it’s dire. And it’s because of that, that I’ll happily turn my back on the world and let my friends uncontrollably cry at my funeral with no regrets. Until I see a change in the mental health system and how people perceive me this will always be my ideology and I do not give a fuck about who thinks differently ",

Throwaway account because pretty sure the guy follows my main reddit account and I don't want him to find out I'm asking about his motives like this to other people.\r  \n\r  \n\\[TW: Mention of ED\\]\r  \n\r  \nSo for context, a few days ago I(19F) had a mental breakdown and proceeds to post lots of concerning things on my main reddit account. Then this guy saw one of my posts, and decided to DM me about it out of concern. We talked for some time, I told him some unhinged shit like how I'm not the owner of my body and how I've been changing it overtime, so he asked for pics which I assume is because he might be worried I've hurt myself or something.\r  \n\r  \nSo I did, I wasn't exactly comfortable and was on full on fight-or-flight mode since I was in a very vulnerable state, not to mention I'm extremely naive and have a hard time telling whether someone's good or bad. I sent him some pics of my before and after (weight loss, lifestyle changes, piercings, etc) and it got me terrified cause I was scared he was gonna make fun of my weight. He then asked me stuff about my wl diet and I was really scared and paranoid because I thought he was gonna call me out on my ED.\r  \n\r  \nMind you at this point I had a feeling he probably already dug through my account and I have posted some stuff to r/EDanonymous and everything so there's no way he doesn't know. But after he pressured me I finally caved in and told him that I only eat like >!600!< kcals a day, but to my surprise he just goes \"\\*pets head\\* good girl\"\r  \n\r  \nI was kinda weirded out at first, but I thought maybe it's because I am actually fat so maybe he's just being understanding why I was losing weight in the first place. But then everyday he kept asking for more pics (not even sexual pics, just normal selfie of me in my pajamas and he said he's asking so because \"it's cute\") and asks how much kcals did I ate that day and complimenting me and calling me cute and a good girl and everything. He also once asked me a picture of my stomach \"so I could compare the before and after and tell if you're losing weight or not\" which I was extremely uncomfortable and terrified because that's my biggest insecurity but in the end I did it anyways as I don't want to make him suspicious (despite already aware he probably knows about my ED already).\r  \n\r  \nAnd I'm just really extremely confused right now because I can't tell if he's doing this out of concern for my well being or because of what. And I know I'm stupid for letting him do a daily check on me like I'm some sort of his pet but my mental state is not exactly in the best place at the moment to say \"no\" to internet strangers. Not to mention I'm super paranoid towards everything so I have a hard time telling whether some stuff is just me being needlessly paranoid or actual threat towards myself.",

A bit disconnecting, finally having the time between me and those times that I blindly believed I would have someday.\n\nI'm very burnt out from spending the whole day making phone calls and trying to wrap my head around the processes, but I'm also left with a lot of feelings, the typical 'I can't believe I made it', and also having to reflect with a newer mindset. \n\nI *genuinely* can't believe I made it. \n\nAfter constant SH urges, both emotional, physical, abuse, horrible coping mechanisms, multiple attempts, still living in the same environment, lots of doctors, so much crying, I can happily say that despite how difficult things are at the moment, they're better than they were.\n\nMy family might not have shifted their treatment of me. I may be physically worse than ever in my life. \n\nBut I continue to grow anyway. \n\nAfter praying to god for years and being given nothing but silent image of an all powerful being watching and listening to my screams for help and doing nothing, my faith is not in divine or religious, not like how I was raised, no, but in myself.\n\nI will never be perfect, but thankfully no one will. As long as I try, and try my best to do well by myself and others suffering too, I remain stronger than ever.\n\nThat keeps me here even if I look back on these 21 years, at how fucking small and scared I was and realize I don't feel much different. I'm still moving forward anyway and I forgive myself for what I did when I was just a child, and someday that scared little kid will be in a better place. \n\nAnd have to say, I have no friends, not in person, but I've had ones I've never met that've saved my life multiple times. Just recently I've been reminded again of how kind people can be and I hope I do right by them as much as they've done by right by me, if it's possible. \n\nI'm very sniffly and weepy and running on like a handful of hours of sleep right now so sorry if this comes off as veeeryyy mushy, but I'm filled with heaviness and hope, and admittedly a lot of anxiety about the future, that lends to a lot of reflection.

Like an idiot, I got my fake with a picture of myself with my real name, but a fake address and fake birthday. I might have just screwed myself over. I gave them a lot of information and I think they would be able to determine that it’s my wallet; I don’t know if any lawyer can get me out of this. Do I call the police report office and void the report saying that I found the wallet or that it’s not worth the hassle since I got new stuff? Should I just stick it out and not respond to the police station if they call? I am hoping someone took the cash and tossed the wallet away or that lost and found at the bus service ends up finding it and doesn’t notice the fake, obviously. Am I screwed? I don’t have much money for a lawyer in the first place. I am a 20 y/o student and this just happened on my 20th birthday of all days of course. What the hell do I do in this situation? Should I just not respond to any calls from the police and pretend none of this ever happened? Can’t they just subpoena me if they can easily prove it’s in my possession with the self report?\n\nI’m feeling so sick to my stomach about this that I haven’t gotten anything done these past two days and have just been sleeping and crying and just can’t muster up enough energy to do anything. I was so worked up about this today that I actually missed my psychiatry intake appointment I had scheduled for months and had to reschedule it to a month and a half in the future. I have no therapist and have tried therapy multiple times with no success. I have been on lamotrigine and duloxetine for almost two years and I feel decent I suppose, but if I miss a dose, I feel lightheaded and nauseous a few hours after I take them at 10 pm every night. I don’t even know if I’m bipolar or not, all that my GP went off of when prescribing me these meds almost two years ago was a terrible situation where I essentially had a bad mental breakdown where I sent some awful text messages to an ex and still feel like I haven’t forgiven myself since because the self inflicted trauma from it is just a lot. Going back to my birthday, though, I was feeling very suicidal after losing my wallet. I feel so fucking bad because I refused to let my girlfriend come in to my house after saying I was going to off myself for around 10-20 minutes, and later tried attempting suicide by swallowing a bottle of pills in front of my girlfriend. I probably gave her irreparable trauma despite her saying that she still loves me and forgives me. I love her and my family and my friends so much, but I hate living and just want it all to end still.",

        "body": "I am 20 y.o. and I suffer depression since age 17. My school years sucked. I’ve never been to parties or hung out with my classmates. I was typical quiet kid who everybody ignores. And I’ve never had friends and relationships. I am still a virgin(except the fact that I had sex for money). And total loser still living with parents. I failed to enroll to university. And it really broke me. Last 2 years I just did nothing and spent whole the time at home, feeling apathy and hopelessness. Now I regret that these 2 years are wasted. My life is a complete failure. I always failed. And I have nothing to be proud of. I hate my height(5’9”) and voice which is more feminine than masculine. At age 20 I have no achievements and I feel inferior and infantile. It seems to me that younger guys are self sufficient and successful, what I can’t say about myself. They work from age 15-16 and at my age they have much more life experience than me. I have never even worked officially. And I feel like had to do it at younger age as well. Because now this fact makes me feel inferior. Life passes me by and there is nothing interesting in it. I’m behind my peers, they went far ahead from me. I have neither working nor studying experience. And feel very pathetic. Once my relative made fun of me in his instagram stories saying that everyone has sex except of me. It frustrated me so hard. And I don’t feel like a man now. I am omega male probably. Maybe that’s why I began to watch cuckold porn and enjoy it. I know that stuff like that is considered abnormal in society and I feel inadequate. Also it seems to me that I am mentally retarded because often I can’t understand logical connections and mathematical issues. At school I wanted to become a programmer but I realize that with my cognitive dysfunction it’s impossible. I am mediocre and worthless. All this makes me accept that I don’t deserve to live. The best period in life is already over. I am in despair. I want to commit suicide but I am too afraid of pain and the fact that it will not be instant scares me. But staying alive has no sense for me as well. I need help and any viral device on what should I do next. I can’t share my feelings to people because they will call me a lazy whiner. Please anybody tell me what would you do in my situation. I feel totally destroyed ",

        "body": "Does anyone have a friend who they are concerned for, who often goes into character or makes jokes to avoid discussing mental health? \n\nMost recently, an old friend, who I have not been in contact with for years, has made troubling social media posts. He often posts convoluted, post traumatic satire, including people in our friend circle who have died or committed suicide. He has struggled with drug abuse and incarnation and an unsupportive family structure. I’ve also heard he’s been homeless as well at one point. \n\nI recently reached out to him, asking if he was ok with meeting to catch up and talk. He did not take it serious at all. I wanted to see if I could help him or see if he just needs someone to talk to. However, he has treated it in a joking manner and is almost going into a character to avoid addressing the issue at hand. I am not a pushy person so I’m trying to respect his boundaries. We have been texting each other for a couple of days now and he will often say something like “I’m recovering from brain damage”. Then when I ask him if he needs help he devolves into a very random ramble about having a 6’5 wingspan and quoting songs. So it’s hard to tell if he just wants me to stop talking to him or if he’s in need of help. \n\nI get that there is random humor and satire of all kinds, but it does not seem like he is in a healthy mindset at all. Am I wrong for trying to figure out if he’s deviating away from the discussion? I know we haven’t talked for a while, and everyone has different coping mechanisms. He does put it on social media which seems like a call for help, whether it is attention seeking or not. ",

As time goes on there’s less wait lists to fill out and updates are farther apart… plus so many wait lists have closed now. I got on as many as I could while they were open. It was one of the few things I immediately got on without procrastinating. They’re only open for a very short time… I live off of SSI ($943 USD) and SNAP ($124 USD in food stamps) so section 8 and similar programs are my only option. Last update I got seems promising but the reality is being close to the top of the list doesn’t tell you how long it’ll be. It could be 6 months or a year or even longer. \n\nI’m a little scared to. I’ve only lived on my own on the streets. This will be my first apartment without roommates. My name will be on the lease, I’ll pay all the rent, I’ll get to have a pet without roommates getting a say in it, I’ll live alone, I’ll only have to worry about my food allergies for groceries (I made a mistake with that once and he almost died. I never stopped feeling horrible about it… even after he said he forgives me and knows it was an accident. Those cookies looked exactly like the safe ones), I’ll be able to leave without telling anyone… I’m equally scared and excited.\n\nIt’s hard to believe I’ll finally be off the streets… I’m happy about that but it’s making me question my own identity. You can take the man out of the streets but you can’t take the streets out of the man!

I am new here, recently I've been experiencing some wild mental health swings as I have been trying different medications (Lamictal, Abilify, and another one I can't remember the name of) to try to treat my.. well whatever is going on with me. I'm sure there is some of that to blame for the way I've been feeling (a revelation I actually just had today) but I can't be sure. I've been going through *alot* of panic and massive anxiety swings that I'm barley able to live life with. I have a long troubled past like everyone else, mostly self inflicted from doing lots of drugs and such but I got clean about 10 years ago and changed my life. I've had some mistakes since then some time spans where I was back out but majority speaking I have been clean until about 2 years ago I started drinking again and taking kratom (which I now can't not take). There's obviously alot more to the story but its not really something I have time to write out all tonight. \n\nThe main point though is I am trying to do better. I have a business, a wonderful long term relationship with a supportive woman, and generally I am proud of myself and where I am.. which is the root of all of this fear - I fear to lose it all. Heres my journal entry from today. I am abit dramatic in my writing sometimes, but hey, I'm a rock musician and like to think of myself as some type of.. poetic writer? Whatever. Here. Dramatic, but not really too exaggerated. Which sucks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMarch 6th, 2024\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's hard to put into words what has been happening to me lately. A rollercoaster of anxiety and panic that seems so out of place, and doesn't make sense. I am terrified of one thing to the next, from the past to my company to my health. It's overbearing. I feel like I am on the edge of some horrible life changing event that is about to happen that I cannot control and will ruin my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI drink sometimes to try to cope lately with the anxiety and fear and sometimes it helps and sometimes it makes it worse. I'd give anything to be free off this suffocating cloud of panic that haunts me every day, in the middle of the night ( I wake up at 2 or 3 AM and just start panicking about the next day of work or other fears) at lunch, when im driving, any time. I feel completely blocked off from the world, maybe even reality, and embarrassed to my girlfriend. She's been so good to me, and supportive. I hate to burden her with this but I really can't suppress it anymore.\n\nWriting this down confirms my fears that this is actually happening to me. I am terrified of a looming shadow. ( My fears, anxieties ) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel fragile, vulnurable and weak. I hope that others cannot see this in me but I am sure that they can. I've been thinking casually (Not intentful at all) about suicide as an option if all my fears are true and it scares the living shit out of me sometimes.\n\nThe shadow (fear, anxiety) is always there reminding me of its presence everytime I start to feel better or peace. Like I am not allowed to feel any joy or hope in fear of it being ripped away from me. Have I brought some kind of darkness into my heart & soul? I don't remember ever feeling this intensely before.\n\nThis is a new enemy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope journaling helps, I am looking for help and healing. \n\n&#x200B;",

        "body": "I’ve been having this issue for over a couple of months now. Basically, whenever I’m bored and want to do a hobby, I 95% of the time just decide to open the phone and open my socials, whether that’d be Reddit, Instagram, YouTube, or Twitter.\n\nI spend most of the time scrolling across the pages for 20 minutes or more. I look at some posts on Reddit, scroll bottomlessly on Instagram, and also scroll bottomlessly on Twitter too. This is causing me to feel very stupid of myself after I put my phone down, as I question what I have been doing and why I have been doing it. And I know it’s something very unimportant to do anyway, but my mind just sometimes urges to view the media that I have missed throughout the day. Like the dopamine triggers me and gives me a boost to view my socials and write down some comments.\n\nAnd this social outbreak I have during the few times that I do it during the day often cause me to have a detox. Mainly when I decide to stop scrolling on social media, I just lie in bed, thinking on what I’m going to do next but the voice inside of my head just makes me lie there without anything to do.\n\nAnd social media is also a BIG issue for my procrastination problems. When I tend to do homework(mostly Mathematics), I procrastinate, like everyone does. But the thing I have a problem with is that my attention shifts towards the scrolling on social media and then after a few minutes it’s what my mind is completely attached to, and I can’t stop as my Math homework just sits there. I could say that this is like ADHD even though I don’t have ADHD. I really want to eliminate this distraction because it’s very common.\n\nAlso, social media has kind of made my eyes feel strained. I don’t scroll at night anymore, which is good, but I scroll for long times during the day, which is terrible for the eyes as the eyes gets tiring which is a big contribution as to why I nap throughout the afternoon, missing out most of the activities that I want to do.\n\nI’ve tried to put Screen Time on my phone, but my dopamine comes in to play in the negative way as I usually just pick up my phone, press the button where it says I don’t want the app to have screen time for the day, and start my scrolling extravaganza.\n\nAnd I’m sometimes worried and interested in the news and communities that I want to be caught up in. Like there’s always this sense I have during the middle of the day where I wonder what’s happening in the news and a certain community I like. I wonder what’s been going viral and what has been reported in the news recently. I try to fight the urge of not taking out my phone and scrolling, but I just end up doing it rather than doing something like conversing with friends, listening to music, or playing a game on the phone(which I find A LOT more better than scrolling.)\n\nI want to quit because I don’t want to be caught up in scrolling anymore. I don’t want to have my personality be materialistic as I tend to care for the stuff on social media. I want my dopamine to be triggered in more positive things and not have a detox over negative addictions. And I want to grow and get used to pursuing new hobbies outside of my devices rather than just scrolling during my time of boredom.\n\nHowever, I’m trying to think of WHAT I should quit:\n\n-I already deleted Twitter. I don’t care about my tweets as they don’t even get popular.\n-I kind of want to stay on Reddit just to POST my thoughts, questions, and images on different subreddits, but at the same time I want to leave it for the better of my mental stability.\n-I’m gonna keep Instagram because me and my friends have some group chats on there, but I’m going to TRY my best not to scroll on it and only use it for the purpose of messaging friends.\n-I’m keeping YouTube 100%. I have no problem with watching videos, as I watch very informative stuff on there.\n\nMy tutor for executive functioning taught me this method called **”Urge Surfing”**, which is a method where I would notice my wanders, but not engage with them and focus on the present moment. That could help me with staying off of social media. And there’s also the **3-2-1**” procrastination method that I decided to use, but it sometimes doesn’t work as I am caught daydreaming.\n\nIf ya’ll have any advice let me know. Social media is really hurting me mentally and I want to make a change within myself so I can improve. ",

        "body": "Honestly my biggest mental health game changer was deleting my socials. I deleted all of my socials about 3 years ago except for Reddit which I rarely used at the time. The only reason Reddit stayed is because for some reason I have better self control and it’s easier for me to close the app. \n\nI can say it’s annoying when friends and family send links of videos and you get the pop up to join.  When this happens I also think about how much more free time I have to dedicate to things that I actually like instead of endless scrolling allowing the algorithm to dictate my life. \n\nHowever prior to deletion please do remember to save or download any pictures/videos that you might want to hang onto for keepsakes. That was my only regret from deleting my socials and at the time thinking I would never want any of those old videos. I lost all of my festival hopping concert videos that I would love to reminisce."

If you feel like you need something more intense right away you can go to the hospital. What will they do? They will most likely check your vitals, take blood and go from there, if everything is normal they will more than likely refer you to their mental health outreach services. \n\nThere are also options such as IOP(Intensive Outpatient Program) and PHP (partial hospitalization programs) both of these are designed to provide extended daily therapy, support and allow you to go back home each evening. You will learn skills and techniques in both a group and individual setting."

        "body": "I have no idea where this feeling has come from or why, but over the past week or so I’ve been experiencing what I can only describe as a constant, nagging, guilty feeling about pretty much anything I do in my life. Now it’s worth mentioning, a few years ago a doctor had formally diagnosed me with depression and I was prescribed Sertraline to treat it, but whatever it is that I’m experiencing right now feels different to that. In fact, overall I’m feeling quite happy, just confused more than anything.\n\nFrankly the things I’ve been feeling guilty about are absurd from an objective, rational perspective. I haven’t hurt or hindered anyone as far as I know. But to give a few examples:\n\n\n1) I’m still living at home and saving up enough money for a deposit on my own first home. I’ve been single for most of my life which doesn’t bother me that much, but it does mean I’m further behind than most people my age and having to spend longer saving up. As a result of spending so many years under the same roof as my mum I’m also very close to her, and as exciting as it will be for me to eventually start the next chapter in my life, I already feel guilty about the day I ‘fly the nest’ and the inevitable void it will leave in our lives.\n\n\n2) An even more obscure example I can give is when I play competitive games online and sometimes I’ll easily win a match, race, etc against less-experienced players. In my mind these could be people who just recently picked up the game for the first time and may feel disheartened being constantly matched up against people that walk all over them due to a lack of experience, and I feel guilty for contributing to that.\n\n\n3) But I would say the peak of my insanity was reached today when I felt I had to hide my plushie away before the electrician turned up in order to avoid having an awkward conversation about it. I even remember feeling guilty about shutting her away in a drawer for a few hours as if I were shunning/abandoning a real person, but maybe that’s from where I’ve anthropomorphised her in an attempt to combat my loneliness.\n\nI know this isn’t normal, but these are just a few of the crazier examples. I’ve always been one to try and put other people before myself and I don’t see a reason to change that, but it’s reached a point where it’s unhealthy and obsessive and I need to know how I can manage these feelings better so that I’m not holding myself back.",

        "body": "Hi I’ve been on lexapro for a couple of months have just now decided to lean off after realizing i was experiencing extreme fatigue from what im sure must be the medication. I had two panic attacks for the first time over a month ago now due to caffeine and so i quit caffeine after having the second one after just one cup of coffee. \nIve been dealing with the most extreme fatigue imaginable as of quiting coffee and having those panic attacks and i had a suspiciam something was making me exausted even when i drank coffee everyday i had already planned to see a doctor about it but hadnt yet suspected lexapro. My question now is how scary can it feel leaning off the medication for you guys because i keep having a fear of death and im going from 10 mg to 7.5 mg, ive already taken 7.5 mg for two nights now and as of today i felt less fatigued but later in the day i was laying down somewhat on my couch and started to feel sick after being on my phone for a prolonged period, but it felt like i was very slightly dizzy or like i couldnt fully allow my senses to perceive the environment like it was too much, it felt like the flew for a second than this started making me anxious and i started to get a cold flash. The best way to describe this was like the suspense feeling of right before you feel like losing control and passing out as a metaphor walking on the side of a cliff like you could just fall. Im not sure if i just psyched myself out and should be fine over the next couple of days or if this is already withdrawal symptoms or im just sensitive, I also had shallow breathing and felt like i was off but felt fine after talking to my dad on the phone. Can anyone relate to this, like i said i have this fear of death, for me it feels like this it almost when that starts to happen. Is this gonna get worse over time or does it get better down the line of withdrawing from the medication, i was already scared to withdraw but in general i feel like i dont need it want to have to take this medication anymore before having those panic attacks i wasnt having any anxiety or depression for months and had already planned on leaning off, i feel like i have all the coping mechanisms and support i need but i am scared obviously because i dont know how bad this could get. I irrationally have worries like can this actually harm me, will this get so bad i cant control it, will this take months for my body to adapt am i gonna be in constant mental anguish, will leaning off prolonge emotional termoil will it just get better. If anyone has dealt with the same or a similar experience and made it through please give me your best words and answer my questions as beat you can to reassure me and i will do my best to be supportive in this group, i appreciate all of you whenever i need help you guys are always there and its hard to say that always about people in my life but thankyou so much guys.

        "author": "Anon_DW_0877",
        "timestamp": "2024-03-07T02:14:37",
        "body": "For some context I'm a 19 y/o male living in Canada, currently enrolled in post secondary. For the past 4 months (definitely longer) I've been having very concerning symptoms that lead me to believe I very likely am developing early schizophrenia and I feel like my life is over. Any thoughts or advice would be more appreciated than you know.\n\nI've always suffered from very serious social anxiety and bouts of seasonal depressive episodes all my life which I was on medication for but other than that no history of any other issues. Schizophrenia does run in my family and I have always been told by my parents to keep an eye on it so when the symptoms first started I immediately began reading up on it.\n\nMy symptoms were first noticed in November when it was starting to get colder, I've always had a really hard time with my seasonal depression, it always made me reclusive, have a big impact on my grades and such but this time around this was way more extreme than it's ever been.\n\nI fully stopped attending my classes and had zero urge to socialize, before this it was like a flip of a switch, I came from highschool with an 80% average and the first couple months went VERY well but then something happened and then all this followed.\n\nI am a very cognitively well person when it comes to memory, my thought process and my word articulation is quite well, when this all started my cognitive functions have DRASTICALLY decreased. I can no longer think more than maybe two sentences all while stumbling and barely being eligible, speaking is even worse I have been saying stuff without being able to properly think about what I want to say so it comes out usually an embarrassing jargled mess. My memory has also drastically decreased, I use to very rarely forget things and now if I place my phone down its a 50/50 I have to fully search a room to find it.\n\nI shrugged this off at first as an effect of the seasonal depression until I started my episodes is what I'd call them.\n\nI noticed I was having a hard time sleeping and it would be extremely inconsistent which was out of the ordinary for me. Then one night, I'm starting to get tired and I can feel something shift, I feel very off, a very heavy anxious type feeling, then I start incoherently mumbling and having incoherent conversations and ideas. I start feeling as if things are crawling on me, but when I check I never see anything. I start hearing illogical house noises, Marbel's rolling in the walls, foot steps in the attic, nearby muffled arguing of my parents, footsteps in my room when it's just me in there, lots of general movement noises and such. I went to check with my mom the next morning if anyone was doing anything at that time or heard anything and she told me absolutely not and that they were in bed. When I pushed to see if they were fighting because I heard them she looked extremely confused and told me no.\n\nThat has happened a handful of times now and every time leading up to it my other symptoms heighten, I have had some visual hallucinations as well, much less common and very faint nothing massive but definitely there. I see these flickerings of what look like grey tv static balls that are clearly not there. When I close my eyes I have constant visuals that are very creepy and dark, most of the time it's nothing legible like just scratches and shapes but sometimes there's faces. These aren't your ordinary ones too, I use to love looking at the closed eye shapes and colours as a kid that everyone has when you stare behind your closed eyes but these are BEYOND vivid and different than anything I've ever had, they also morph into what I think of them somewhat so if I am scared they usually turn dark.\n\nAs stated in the beginning I suspected this has been going on for a lot longer than I realize, I never noticed but when I take a step back I've always had long periods of time where I flip and begin to disassociate and become a recluse and sort of take a 180 of what I was prior to changing moods, I've also had an extremely large number of times I've heard my name being called/seen shadows run by and then when I follow up with if I really did hear/see these things I'd be told no by everyone else, but it never clicked with me at the time I thought it was just me being overly alert.\n\nWhen I started hitting puberty I began to have very unmanageable obsessive compulsive issues too, I'd accidentally pick up strange habits/rituals which have drastically gotten less manageable as I've gotten older which would practically make me have to complete them or I would have a constant sense of unease/discomfort and with my psychotic episodes they have never been more worse. A lot of compulsive thoughts (nothing violent towards other people ever) of suicidal ideation mainly, when I was younger a lot about simulation theory to the point I thought myself and a lot of other people were not real, general conspiracies, religion and such to the point where it's all I think about and nothing else, and it's all extremely negative and taking a huge impact on my life. No matter how much destaine I have for all of these things, my mind makes me unable to stop for longer than short durations without my brain being consumed with it which makes me slip into a very declining place and eventually completing the ritual which reinforces the habit, and makes me feel even more lost and hopeless since I can't overcome it.\n\nI'm currently destroyed, I have no idea what I should do. I failed out of every class this year, due to my social reclusive urges from it I was distanced from my love of my life who decided to end things, I was wanting to pursue a career in law enforcement but now with this I know I cannot. I'm just feeling as if my life is done for, will I get sent to a hospital if I tell my doctor? Will I ever be able to find a good career?\n\nI'm sorry this is such a long post, would just really like some outside perspective.\n\nTl;Dr: every symptom in the book for early onset schizophrenia, failed first year due to the symptoms I'm having, never going to be able to work my dream career, girlfriend of four years left, where do I go from here?",

i need the thoughts of strangers. if this is not supposed to be in this subreddit, then let me know and i will ABSOLUTELY remove it. i do not want to hurt anyone, but i have an extremely tumultuous past month and i needed some answers. even if they are incorrect.\n\ni grew up in what i think is a stable environment, though i cannot recall many happy memories of being little. i can recall instances of physically punished and emotionally manipulated. this began around the time i was three years old. both of my parents heavily favored my brother, and when i reacted to this i would be said to be dramatic and disrespectful. this disrespect would to a lot of word games, and, i don’t really remember how often- but being repeatedly spanked and slapped in the face. i was never bruised, but these altercations left welts on my skin. when my mother regained her composure she would cry, apologize, and tell me that she would never do it again. she has always failed to keep her promise. \n\nmy mother has been emotionally abused her whole life, and by my father the entirety of their relationship. i don’t remember when she started doing this, but she divulges every argument or unkind word my father says to her to me. she talks to me about how she is going to leave him, but she never does and never will. she treats me more like her best friend than her daughter, but her mindset and attitude volley back and forth.\n\nmy father is extremely misogynistic, and this is the reason he favors his son. he is also extremely “reactive.” he has been picking fights with me since my brother was born, when i was around six years old. he is extremely passive aggressive, and frames it as a joke. when you respond, you are dramatic and cannot take a joke. when you don’t respond, he still gets upset and hurls insults. he yells very much in my face, and tries to intimidate. when i am not intimidated, it sets him off more. once he was putting bowls inside of other bowls in the diswasher, and i said very jovially, that i believed he had too much in the dishwasher. this ultimately escalated to the point that he shoved me across the kitchen telling me to “get out of his face.” but he is the one who reared up to me. when this was later mentioned, he had done nothing wrong. i have never once received and apology or admittance of guilt from my father. he is the innocent victim in all situations he is involved in. this has impacted me moreso than my mother’s goings on.\n\ni feel the need to add that both of my parents suffer from marijuana use disorder, and i guess become violent if they have not used. \n\ni do not think that these things are that bad, but when i go into greater detail i am consoled and told that it is not normal. when i receive this response, i am afraid that i am faking what has happened to me and that i am being dramatic. i remember thinking when i was younger that when my parents hurt me that one day i would fake never being the same again, and they would feel guilty. like ralphie’s soap poisoning in a christmas story. i would be sad at school and wish for people to feel bad for me. i’m afraid that i am still doing this, but do not realize that i am. i feel that i am depressed, and sometimes manic. i make rash decisions, usually choices of words, that end meaningful relationships. in the time after i make these choices, i feel that i am completely correct and that i finally spoke up and gave the person what was coming to them. later, sometimes months later- i blame myself for what happened, and am consumed by guilt and regret.\n\nthe person i admire most in the world assured me for years that i was not faking and that i was not evil, in our relationship ending fight he took it all back- calling me toxic and crazy. he was the only reason i felt i had to believe that i was sane, and his words sent me into a spiral that no one truly understands. it has been nearly a year since this end, in which i have begged for his forgiveness. he tells me he wishes nothing but the best for me, but never apologized for how i feel he wronged me. i believe he emotionally manipulated me to get what he wanted, but that too i am afraid i am faking. \n\nin our time apart i have struggled with a lot derealization, anxiety, depression, and marijuana use disorder. i feel that i drive the people i love to leave me, and that once people really know me they don’t like what they see. i am very afraid of being manipulated and abandoned. i have spent the last year afraid to make friends, because i find it hard to trust people. that is the thing i feel i am faking the most. \n\ncan anyone tell me if i am insane? what does it sound like is wrong with me? have i been abused? am i faking the impact that my experiences have had on me?

When I notice people ( especially very attractive people ) looking at me , or flirting with me, I crumble. Even my body posture gets so bad. My body is essentially on flight response ( not even on 'fight'). If I have to present at work, I feel anxious,  my voice cracks, and I just want to cry. \n\nLogically, I understand I have traumas and  insecurities from my childhood ( I was bullied and pushed around when I was a kid). Yet, today I am intelligent, good looking ( again sorry if this makes me sound conceited) and successful in my career. And this is what gets me . What else do I need to feel confident ? I feel like I am close to reaching my peak, and yet I don't feel confident at all. \n\nI want to put this past me because I want to build more friends, I want to have better relationships with people, find a loving partner, and feel better about myself. But I don't know what to do. \n\n\nDisclaimer: I am not saying I'm the guy everyone dreams about. I know I am not many people's cup of tea, but I also would lie if I said I didn't realized many people find me attractive. \n\nPlease don't be rude, but feel free to be honest. ",

        "body": "I have been in my stepdaughters life since she was one. She is now four. Her father and I got her full time a year ago. She was very attached to her mom, but she was witnessing DV and a lot of fighting between her mom and boyfriend, and they ended up becoming homeless living in a tent. She is in a much better situation now with us, but it was traumatizing for her leaving her mother. She has regressed back into not being potty trained, quit eating, and was obviously depressed. She has gotten so much better and is now a happy, normal playful kid. However, she still is really struggling with disassociating to the point where it’s affecting her day to day life. She is in dance class and doesn’t pay attention or is even focused at all in class, she just twirls around and doesn’t even participate in anything her peers are doing. At daycare she does the same. She’s severely struggled to make friends (which at 4?? It shouldn’t be hard to make friends at that age) because she is just always in her own little world and does not acknowledge anyone or anything going on around her. \nThis has been really hard for me because I was severely abused and starved as a child and did the same thing. My parents locked me in an empty room and fed me once a day from 2nd grade to 8th(“homeschooled”), so I disassociated and spent my whole time daydreaming. I just now am starting to not disassociate as often, but it still happens. Her father works overnights so he is not home most of the time and when he is, he’s normally sleeping. He is off weekends so he does not see how she interacts with other people, so he doesn’t see what I see. It has been a huge struggle for me trying to help her handle her trauma. Therapists in my town and nearby are not taking new patients and most won’t work with a 4 year old child, the closest to me is 3 1/2 hours away which is not attainable for me. So I have been pretty much on my own and it’s very triggering and difficult. It breaks my heart seeing her this way and I wish more than anything that I was capable to help her but I have no idea how. It’s hard… \n",

No dont sit on your phone but explore what others do for hobbies, you might like drawing, or similar to me i like cold showers and exercise as a hobby, and for showers, ease it, start your next shower as just water, no soap, just get in the shower and maybe lather your hair with water, then get out, dry off and keep doing that. And if you ever dont want to lather your hair with water no biggy, its water! Please do not give up i was in your spot for over 3 years and now im about to enlist into the army. Stay strong man.

If you are often dissociated from sensations in your body or have a hard time recognizing feelings in your body you may not be able to read your own hunger cues or appetite. Anxiety can cause a lack of appetite. Any activated trauma systems can cause lack of appetite. Basically if your nervous system is in fight, flight? Or freeze mode it focuses on only the parts of you brain/nervous system it needs for survival and quite literally shuts down other bodily functions like digestion. That’s why sometimes when someone is anxious grounding by taking sips of water can help because it “turns back on” your digestive system by forcing it to have to do something with the water."

        "body": "Don’t care about a burner account. I need help. \n\nSince 2014 I’ve been in a steep mental health decline and I think I just hit my breaking point. COVID completely sucked the rest of my drive for just about everything away. I voluntarily quit my job in which I got no over time, worked 6 days a week, 50+ hrs a week, would get criticized about taking time off during yearly review and had a boss who was a COVID denier and would invite people to our shop when he knew they had COVID. It was a shit profession and I’m glad I stepped down but that was just the start. \n\nI recently had moved back at home with my parents because I was getting ready to buy a house. COVID went nuts and my parents split. My dad and younger, special needs brother moved out with my Grandma and I decided to stay with my father’s wife . It fucking sucked but my “mom” was a verbally abusive bitch so I kind of understood it. Consistently got gas lit. My first memory of her was when I was probably 3 years old. My dad was working a job out of town trying to find a house so we could move elsewhere. My father’s wife would hide me in my room while her boyfriend was over and they’d obviously be fucking but I had no idea. The boogey man was real for me. She would leave a sack of condoms on the kitchen table and I thought they were balloons when I was younger.\n\nWe’ll move a few months into lock down, now. My father’s ex didn’t really give a shit about social distancing, would hangout with her sister when she’d come in town to see her friends from FL, the then COVID hotbed of the US. My only form of social interaction was once a month going to my cousins for an outdoor bonfire. There was one occasion where I got guilt tripped into going to a family cookout because my cousin spent good money on chicken. Long story short huge COVID outbreak. I’m sick, father’s ex is sick, grandmother, not good. Grandma and father’s ex are sent to the hospital. One evening while I was cooking, my father’s ex called me from the hospital and said they were ready to release her. I dropped everything I was doing to pick her up. The moment we got home she went off the deep end. Chastising me about a dirty kitchen and had the audacity to blame me for her bed being slightly messy because her dog sleeps in it. We argued and nothing was resolved the following morning. Words were said and it was stated that I was the sole reason the family got COVID. I packed up all my things and moved out that day. I’ve spoken to her maybe 3 times since. The last time was an over the phone brawl where I screamed for probably 2 hrs straight at her. I hate that piece of shit human. \n\nNow we’ll change gears and focus on my father. His ex never did anything around the house and was stuck with all the cleaning, cooking, and child care activities. My father is hyper aware of my brothers limitations (he’s wheelchair bound since birth) and I love my brother with every fiber in my body. I don’t hold anything against him. But my father’s ex emotionally and verbally abused me my whole life and my father neglected me by never doing anything together. Never would play catch after dinner, wouldn’t golf in the evenings with me because he wants to keep a bathroom and shower schedule for my brother. After years and years of being denied attention from my father I gave up. I went to the same college as him, studied what he wanted me to study, applied for jobs he thought I should have. I literally did anything to get a sliver of attention. My grades even dropped like crazy in middle school and when confronted, I replied, “I was just hoping to get paid attention to.” Nothing ever changed. When I would make a mistake I was threatening with, “we’re going to give your pet away away”. I would get absolutely laid into. When I asked why he talked to me in such a tone and never that way with my brother his response was, “because you can take it”. As a 30+ year old man I broke into tears and told him I never could and it was horse shit he would tell my brother he’d love him more times in a day than he’d say to me in a year. \n\nThings got better for a while. Even through I burned through my savings supporting myself without a job during COVID I was still alive. Started going back to school and to help with tuition my father offered me a room at the old house and I accepted. Now, my father has decided that he wants to start dating again and has given the responsibility of caring for my brother when he’s gone. My father doesn’t allow my brother to do almost anything on his own. His reasoning,”it’s a little hard for him. You want me to duct tape your legs and you can sit in chair all day?”. All the Bull shit he would tell me about schedules for my brother and routines went right out the window. He leaves for days on end and when we ask when he’ll be back his response is “I don’t have a curfew”. \n\nMy father basically gave up his life to raise my brother. And I’m scared shitless that I’m not going to be able to afford care for myself, my brother, or this new house they want to build for him when my dad dies. He left Friday without telling either of us his plan and was silent until he strolled in Monday night. He’s off again with his girlfriend tonight and again, no thank you for taking care of his son and no idea when he’ll return. My brothers thanks me consistently and I would do anything for him but the lack of respect and communication has me down bad. I just went through the house and took down all the photos of me.  At this point, I don’t even know if he is my dad with how trashy his ex wife was. I work two PT jobs, one for a small business right now and the other involved with education. The small business is going under, it’s routine that I can go 3-4 weeks without a paycheck at this point. Boss is paying payroll with personal credit cards. I’ve been trying to get on state subsidized health care but after a month and a half they still can’t get me an updated insurance card so I can’t seek help even if I wanted it. \n\nSorry for the long post, but I’m losing my sanity after 30+ years of neglect and abuse.

My mom keeps a dog locked in a cage, whining and chewing at her fur for over a year now.

She blew up at me on my little sister's birthday saying I was wrong, she wasnt abusing the dog, and that I shouldnt be telling anyone about this. Literally my mom dad and brother were all yelling at me for telling peoples about the dog thing and I feel so lost. I really dont think I did anything bad. Im not going out telling people what my moms doing. Im just trying to relate to people and talk about our pets. They told me I should just say I dont have any pets.\n\nI really want to keep them in my life and have parents but they really hurt me and make me sad.

        "body": "Sup,\n\n\nSo, I found myself in a medical joint known for dealing with folks who'd partied too hard with substances or were wrestling with their inner voices.\n\n\nThis one day felt like a scene straight out of a horror movie. I was just wandering the halls, trying to kill time, when suddenly, this guy starts freaking out. It was intense—he had this wild look in his eyes, like he was fighting off some invisible monster only he could see, and he was screaming \"LET ME GO!\" at the top of his lungs. His voice was so filled with fear, it bounced off the walls and made everyone freeze and just stare. It was as if the air turned heavy, like before a storm hits, and you could feel the tension everywhere.\n\nThe nurses, who are usually pretty chill, jumped into action like they were characters in some dark, twisted game, moving towards him with this super serious vibe they had going on. To someone just passing by, it might've looked like they deal with this kind of drama all the time, but there was this vibe that something really bad could happen. You could half-joke that they were taking him to some secret room for a time-out, but nope, they actually took him to this place they call the \"safe room.\" It's meant to be a spot where you can just take a breath and chill, but with the heavy mood, it felt more like a quiet corner in a haunted house where you're left alone with your thoughts.\n\nHonestly, it was a reminder of how real and close to the edge things can get in a place like this, and it made the whole \"healing\" vibe of the facility feel a bit more complicated. It's weird how a place meant to pull you out of the darkness sometimes feels like it's got shadows of its own.",

After I was bullied as a child, I’ve always been anxious and insecure, leading me to develop an ED when I was 13, and after a few years my parents sent me to a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with ADHD. However I just feel like there is something else. Whenever I try to talk to someone about how bad it actually is I feel like they don’t believe me. Like I just can’t talk about it as if I was embarrassed. Im always extremely pessimistic, I’d cry 24/7 if I could, and I always pity myself. I feel like I’m not worth anything even though there’s no reason for me to think so. I overthink my relationships with others and everything I ever say or do. I can’t imagine me ever finding love or success in life. Idk what to do to stop this. I’m currently a student and this is getting in the way of my studies. I still go to psychiatry but I am not able to open about this. \n",

Realising I don’t have any (real) friends, only my partner, but I’m questioning the relationship as of right now. On one part I love the way we function irl mostly, but online it’s weird. I noticed we don’t laugh a lot with each other (not meaning that we’re unhappy, just not laughing) and have hardly anything to talk about with each other. It doesn’t really bother me since I’m a rather quiet person but I’m questioning if this is „not normal“. We also fought a lot when we started dating, so I definitely changed a lot of behaviours in the relationship. Most changes I like, some I don’t.\n\nBut also, I feel genuinely lonely. I don’t want to admit it, but I don’t have any real friends. No one is really checking up on me, and I came to the realisation that most people in my life didn’t stay there for long or were fake. I also feel like a splinter when trying to engage in people talking about whatever. Maybe I don’t see people caring about me, maybe I perceive myself very different than other people do. But this is how I feel, and I’m starting to feel lost. If anyone is interested, I’d explain this a bit further, since it is a really complicated topic with me.\n\nI’d appreciate answers on where my process of thinking may be wrong, what I could possible be doing wrong or could change. Thanks in advance.",

And it isn’t insulting, most people struggle to ‘love themselves’ due to recent norms we are given, honestly I do love myself, I love how I think and how I am. Keep in mind loving yourself doesn’t mean you think you’re perfect. It means you accept the flaws and pros of yourself. For me one of my main flaws was lack of emotional understanding, and I’ve been working on that to love myself more. Honestly loving yourself is pretty hard. And it does make you more judgmental. But not because of ego but because your standards naturally get higher. And most people probably wont meet those standards. I hope that clears some things up for you.

What I would start trying is thinking of what to say in yes or no situations, example: some friend offers you something that might not be smart in the long run. Don’t say no to start, just say “maybe another time” eventually youll turn that into a no thanks. I wish i could give actual tips or information but Im not certified in mental health or things like that, depending on where you live there might be programs for 18yos to get therapy for free, which might be beneficial might not."

        "body": "\n\nI wish this never happened to me, not even on my worst enemy.\n\nWhen I was 15, I used to love a game called Sky, a game categorized as one of the nicest and most accepting communities out there on the internet, and people don’t usually get bad experiences there; but I did, and it was horrible. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to share the name because I was scared of more bullying, or people saying that I’m making this up, for not liking their community. That’s how stressed I was. \n\nI mainly played it for its musical mechanics, their piano. I used to play it so much that it was just the only thing that made me feel alive. Over time, I encountered many issues in the game so I wanted to rant about it in the community, not in a rude way. Issues with the game mechanics, and other things, like not wanting to be recorded without my consent when I play music. (It made many people there angry for some reason) I also tried proposing ideas to the developers of that game, to tweak a few things so that it’s easier for me to play, they said they’ll get back to that, but never did. \n\nBut because to those certain people in that community, it was a ridiculous thing to be stressed over. So they ridiculed me, and called me names, and said some of the worst shit you can think of, because that’s what the internet does; a massive cesspool, a place where you can anything you want, and not get consequences. A few remaining people still tried to help but were mostly puzzled, but didn’t get why I was so upset over the issue. I wish I knew that before I posted. I didn’t realize at the time that this interaction would truly put a dent in me. \n\nThat was over 3 years ago. For a long time I wanted them to apologize for what they did. To apologize that they hurt me, so much that not even words can even describe my hurt. \n\nThen I realized; no one cares, I had to cope with the fact that I only had myself, that no one actually cares. I’ve never felt so lonely, so isolated, dejected; it seemed as if no one else had my issues, which made me feel even more lonely, I then get angry and then I cry, and the cycle repeats. It wasnt fair; everyone else gets to be content with their games, while I get traumatized. I remember feeling hopeless for a long time. I wanted to disappear. I probably wouldn’t have mattered anyway, poof, gone in the wind, literally. Haha…….\n\nI’m 18 now. I’m recovering, but recovery has been tough. I’m getting by day by day. I’m slowly accepting that some people are just assholes. And I just gotta move on, despite how painful it was for me. I’m choosing to do other better things in life for me. Hobbies like math, music (other instruments not related to sky), or art. It won’t resolve whatever happened but it suppresses my thoughts for a few hours, like alcohol but without the effects of being drunk. I cannot ever go to the past, and change what happened, what happened truly traumatized me, and I don’t think it’ll ever go away. \n\nI remember posting about this in this subreddit three years ago. it made me feel bad that no one replied, but wasn’t sure why it was like that. \n\nI miss my sky musical instrument. It might’ve even become my career choice, if that existed. ",

        "body": "its shitty to hear an online \"wholesome\" dubbed community changed its tune on you. I will say it is hard to really gauge how to help without really seeing the original post for context. As someone who is turning 30 and pretty much was bullied from kindergarten til senior year of high school. My only community was WoW (world of warcraft). I did everything in my power to be one of the best and i made it to the top of my guild, as the raid leader for the most difficult raid at the time (ICC H10/25) I was 14 or 15 at the time. \n\nIt was weird giving adults directions and sometimes they didnt like that especially new people. I used my being bullied in the real world as a way to not get bullied online. It only worked for so long. The new Cata expac was coming out and with having done the raid like 600 times and guild tensions rising, it all fell apart. The guild dissolved after 2 years of being together and hitting server first. I had nothing and no one... \n\n...so i thought. \n\nA few days after the guild was no more someone at school tried to bully me, and i had, had enough. I was 1 of 11 white kids in my school. So I sacked up and got into my first fight. I wasnt dumb enough to throw the first punch but i wasnt the one who went down. Now im not condoning physical violence, im not using this as a reason to go fight bullies or play batman, i defended myself in real life. I empowered myself to fight back for once and stance up for myself.\n\nAfter that day i was never bullied again, and none of my friends were. Its all about sitting in the discomfort and learning to over come. \"Perseverance through adversity\" is a saying everyone should lean into.\n\nIf thing are effecting you i suggest you try one of these options. There is no judgement here, im just imploring you to challenge yourself to rise and overcome this occasion.\n\n1. get in touch with a mental health professional, or talk to your family about looking for someone to talk to if you cant afford it on your own.\n\n2. Try to challenge yourself to stay off of games more consistently and pick up a hobby like warhammer, magic the gathering or some other table top game. Going to your LGS (local game store) will allow you to meet tons of cool people who all do the same thing and are some of the least judgmental people ive met.\n\n3. Remind yourself that the world is full of bad and GOOD people. its not a perfect ratio, everyone walking down the street may or may not want to talk to you, but honestly you dont know until you make contact. Seems like you have a solid grasp on how the internet public forum works so thats a good start. \n\n4. A dose of humility goes a long way. We all say shit we dont mean or we deliver completely out of context, we are humans and make mistakes. It is unfortunate that people DO actively choose to be shitty, but the good news is you get to choose to be good or shitty too. You cant be perfect and anyone to expect so is a nut job. \n\n5. Give yourself a break, but dont cut yourself all the slack. Opinions are like assholes, we all have one, right. Criticism is killer, good or bad, it just takes some mental fortitude to learn how to take criticism. I used to not be able to handle it at all, and it made me a toxic ass human for a while. Learning to accept that not everyone will agree or like what you say (within means, like dont go being a conspiracy theorist, as much as they are funny).\n\n6. You know what you know, and you dont know what you dont know. BUT you do know what you do know and if you dont know, then learn... now youre back in the know"

I bolt like the wind. I feel zero guilt about it.\n\nThere are great online communities and there are horrible ones and it doesn’t even have anything to do with the topic of shared interest of the group. I belonged to a guinea pig Facebook group. I started to see some judgmental posts, like when someone posted a photo of them holding their guinea pig with their dog in the photo, it was deleted by admins because it was encouraging “dangerous behavior”. Anyway, one time I commented “He has furbrows!!” On a photo of a guinea pig (you know, like fur in the pattern of eyebrows) and the admins scolded me and banned me for a week because that comment was “bullying the guinea pig”. \n\nSo I examined myself. WAS I bullying the guinea pig? Does my behavior warrant changing? And I decided, no. this is ridiculous. I’m leaving.\n\nI quit the guinea pig group, and I found another Facebook guinea pig group, and I’ve belonged to it for years and all day long we celebrate our piggies and we live in peace and harmony and I love it. 🐹\n\nmy point is, it sounds like you’re a person who needs community just as much as I do and it really affected you deeply to feel so much rejection from one. I’m sorry that happened, it is a crappy feeling and over time you’ll think about it less often but it will always feel bad when you do. I’m 41 and when I belonged to an acapella group in college they kicked me out via an email and I still feel sadness and disgust from that social rejection on the rare occasions I think about it. It is normal to have those feelings. We are social animals. We need social connections and we feel threat when they are severed.\n\nI suspect you might be hovering in this dark void because you want community but you’re worried it will happen again. I hope you get to where you can seek out a new community - in video games or any other hobby - and fill the void with joy in your connections there, or if it turns out the group is not great, feel liberated to quit it without a second thought.\n\nAlso, terrible people can be more terrible when they are online behind the veil of anonymity. So if you want to reduce the risk of encountering that, you might want to pursue in-person groups in your community - just be aware that interpersonal conflict is almost inevitable no matter what form a group takes.\n\nBest wishes"

        "body": "I’ve been in a Radically-Open DBT program for over a year now. Originally I assumed I would complete the program in 9 months and “graduate,” but I have not been making improvements or using the skills, and therefore I’ve started the program over again. \n\nI can tell that the skills we learn would likely be so helpful, and I can tell they are designed to benefit us and help us feel better in the long run. I believe in DBT and I trust that mental health professionals know more than I do. I trust the current DBT center I’m working with and believe they have everyone’s best interests at heart. But for some reason, I just cannot seem to implement the skills being taught. I am insanely scared of losing control, being in uncomfortable situations that I can’t escape from, and losing myself completely. \n\nFor some context, I did have a bad experience with a former therapist who chose to quit on me spontaneously mid-session and then kicked me out when I had a panic attack about it. I have a lingering fear that my current individual therapist will quit on me, tell me she can’t help me anymore and that DBT isn’t working and send me on my way to figure out something else. I’ve told her about my trauma and my fears of being abandoned, and she’s reassured me that she’s not going anywhere. But my friend from our skills class got kicked out for not giving other people enough chance to talk, sharing too much, asking too many questions, etc. so I know they could kick anyone out of the program if they wanted to (they were nice to her and suggested that a support group would be better for her needs but the fact that she got kicked out scares me). \n\nI have such a hard time implementing the skills that are being taught. I can’t stand small talk, talking to strangers, etc. and I have an extremely hard time making eye contact, displaying open social signaling, etc. I’m scared of people taking advantage of me so I feel like I have to be a frozen brick wall at all times. \n\nMy individual therapy sessions have gone downhill significantly. Ive always cried a lot in our sessions because she tells me a lot of things I don’t wanna hear, but lately it’s increased tenfold. I feel insanely inferior around her, like I’m a terrible student and she’s a disappointed teacher. I cannot look her in the eye and I’m finding it harder and harder to be myself in front of her because it feels like everything I say or do is being scrutinized and judged. I know she doesn’t purposefully pass judgment on her clients in a negative way, but I’m “aware of imagining” (awareness continuum) that she thinks I’m a heartless, selfish, self-victimizing person. My crying in session has been pointed out as a “don’t hurt me response,” implying that I’m trying to manipulate and control the situation by crying and acting hurt so she stops giving me feedback I don’t wanna hear. I guess subconsciously I could be doing that, but in all honesty I feel like I can’t help it. The crying is very real and I feel broken inside. I desperately want to be understood but don’t feel like I am. \n\nI’m too scared to make the necessary changes. I’ve dug myself in so deep that if I were to get better, I would feel bad about myself for being “wrong” and my therapist could be thinking, “I told you so.” I feel that I’m incapable of making the changes, but every time I say that, she says “what are you trying to communicate by saying that?” As if I’m telling her indirectly that I’m refusing, but the truth is I’m SCARED that I’m incapable and I’m looking for her to prove to me that I am. But I know she can’t. \n\nNot to mention the program is insanely expensive, my mom is paying for it, and I feel extreme guilt that I’m not making the most of it. \n\nI don’t know what I’m asking for in this post, just to be heard I guess.

It’s horrible, and much worse than watching a scary movie or going on a rollercoaster. The physical sensations that fear brings are easy to brush off, but it’s the emotional feeling that is unbearable."

        "body": "Another thing you can do is slow your heartbeat, and that makes your fear go down. I'll tell you how to do it and how it works.\n\nYour emotions are attached to your autonomic nervous sytem, the system of nerves that control your fear responses - heartbeat, sweat, etc. When you see something scary, the system puts you in fear mode. Those two things, the ANS and emotion, always work together. Always.\n\nAnd it works in reverse. Take your ANS out of fear mode and the fear goes.\n\nOf all the ANS functions, there's one you can control - breathing. If you change your breathing rate, that hacks your ANS. It slows heartbeat etc. That changes your mood.\n\nYou know DBT paced breathing. Use it when you're afraid. Keep using it until you're calm.\n\nThere are scores of laboratory and clinical studies showing that this works. It will help you because you have the same ANS and limbic system as everybody else, all mammals."

I try to tell myself that I do not have to do it but there’s just a voice in my head that tells me that I do have to, but it’s weird because that’s my voice in my own head, but I ju  at cant control it.

        "body": "So like firstly, karma is a weird thing. It's more like quests than it is rewards and punishments, interesting little ideas.\n\n\nThat said, there's a certain quiet hell in these things. If someone does you harm, doesn't recognise that and doesn't change, the retribution for you is that they're still the person who will fuck things up. The scorpion and the frog is a good enough fable to illustrate the point. In short, a frog let's a scorpion across a river on its back. The promise is the scorpion won't sting while riding the frog as they'll both drown. Then the scorpion, because of its nature, stings the shit outta the frog and they both drown. This is mostly how the good thing bad thing idea of karma does play out, rather than like do wrong in New York, get hit by car in Paris. So someone who cheated to start a relationship is going to have the cheating flavour the entire relationship, and they have to deal with being a cheater. Scorpions sting and cheaters cheat, and if they fixed this part of themselves and moved on the \"karma\" here is the hard work they have to put in to do so.\n\n\nAnother idea: consider the person who gets everything they want, instantly with no work. They just wish, and it becomes true. Possessions, romantic or sexual partners, experiences, etc. Sure they have all the stuff, but they miss out on a lot of the human experience, they have no reason to build character, nothing to build them into something more formidable. It's a more hollow way to live. Shit didn't work out for you, so maybe you used this time to introspect, to grow, to develop yourself. If it did work out, would you have grown how you have? The cost of getting what you want is who you'd become in spite of it."

Doing good things, such as being generous, honest, and not cheating, change the way you EXPERIENCE the world. \n\nIt can help not to use karma as some form of measurement stick - it's not about what someone has, or what happened to them vs you and how everyone is dealing with things.

So since I've been around 10 she started controlling everything I ate saying it was a \"balanced diet\". Now dont get me wrong it's not about only eating vegetables.  But eating less, not having candies , having to do sports. \n\nSo now I'm 16 , a competitive ice skater with a boyfriend (let's call him M) and I have 10kg overweigt compared to my height. Ive been trying to loose weight but with all of the sports and water I drink I dont loose a Gram on the scales. So she always goes \"You're eating behind my back\" and I'm not. She doesn't believe me. Reminds me like every day that I have big thighs and that I should look 10kg. I get pissed off and tell her that I got it since. She yells saying that I talk back in a rude way , that it's because of my boyfriend . When I ask her to tell me what's wrong when I speak because I dont get where I talk rudely to her she just goes \"I dont want to talk to you anymore. Have fun with M. You're 16 You're old enough to take care of yourself. I won't tell you anything\"\n\n\nWhat should I do?",

        "body": "Dieting is complicated. There’s so many different methods and a lot of it is bs. Many dieticians are spreading lies because it’ll keep their clients going back to them. I think having less carbs is part of the solution, so cutting out candy is good, but from what I’ve heard, it’s also fine to sometimes treat youself. It’s all about balance. If being a healthy weight requires you to torture yourself, then you’re doing it wrong, there have to be easier ways. Unfortunately I myself am not a pro in dieting either, but I can definitely tell you that it’s not your fault, you’re not doing anything wrong. Maybe instead of listening to your mother, who doesn’t know anything about dieting and healthy eating herself, you could talk to a dietician or a personal trainer? Unfortunately, this entire industry is very toxic and it’s very difficult to find actual good people who actually know what they’re talking about and want the best for you. A part of a healthy lifestyle is also learning to love yourself for the way that you are. You can still work hard and try to be the best version of yourself, but you should love yourself at each stage of the process. Easier said than done. I didn’t overcome my body dysmorphia until I moved away from my mother. I’m still healing from the pressure and body standards that she put on me. I’m honestly still quite depressed and have been eating nothing but junk lately, but surprisingly, I haven’t gained any more weight than what I had when I was actively “dieting”. Which just proves that all the pressure to starve myself put onto me by my mother was completely useless. It didn’t do crap. Your mother is toxic. You SHOULD go and have fun doing it yourself. Go ask for advice from someone who actually knows wtf they’re talking about and who shows you respect despite your current weight. There are good people out there who will be open to helping you, you just have to find them. Don’t accept help from people who disrespect you, insult you or make you uncomfortable in any other way, they’re not trying to help you because they care about you, they’re only doing it because they equate being fat to being stupid, so that they can feel better about themselves. Have respect for yourself and your body and do things in your own tempo."

        "body": "I feel too weak to do anything. I started feeling like life was a bit too much to handle since about 5 years ago, when I finished middle school. My mom has always encouraged me to be a high-achiever and even though I felt burned out at the end of middle school, she still forced me to go to one of the best high schools in my country. She didn’t exactly force me, she basically just said that if I go to another high school then I’ll never achieve anything in life. Obviously I’ll trust my mother and do as she believes to be right.  \n\nFirst two years of high school were exhausting but it got worse after an SA incident. I just happened to go on an exchange year to a foreign country the same year that it happened. The exchange year location was also encouraged by my mother, since she said that my country of preference was “completely useless” and “you won’t ever use that language in the future” and “you won’t achieve anything in life if you ever move there”. So I chose the country that she recommended. I stayed at one host family that was borderline abusive and made me feel paranoid about people people hating me, in addition to the guilt I felt about the SA incident. Then I went to another host family and slept as much as it was possible with the obligation to go to school. They also eventually started hating me for never spending any time with them and always shutting myself in my room.  \n\nI finished high school in my home country, also struggling throughout the entire year. At least I decided to find a therapist for the first time in my life. I looked around for different therapists with the main focus to overcome the SA incident, but also to become more motivated in school. Noone could help me. Either they said they were “underqualified” for this topic or I just had a horrible connection with them and a bad experience going there. I begged my mom to have a gap year at the end of high school so I can rest, but she said that I’m already a year behind everyone else and I already did have a gap year (the exchange year), so should be fully rested. That was not a rest. She said I could have a gap year if I got a job, but that doesn’t sound like something that will let me recover either. I worked 13h shifts the previous summers, which led me passed out on my bed each weekend and unable to put time into doing anything I love. I decided to go back to my exchange year country to university, because it’s the best way to get away from my family. I have a boyfriend there to support me and my parents will keep financially supporting me as long as I’m studying.  \n\nI failed the first semester. I have to retake it but meanwhile I’ll be continuing with the second semester. I think I’ve finally hit a wall. I spend half my day on my phone. I can’t fall asleep before 3AM. I wake up in time to go to school but I can’t motivate myself to actually get out of bed and go to school. I’m crying almost every other day. I haven’t done any homework. I’m skipping every class that doesn’t track attendance. The semester has just started but I know I’m going to fail. I just don’t have any motivation to keep going. I started talking to another therapist, but it’ll take at least a few months for me to overcome this state, if I ever do.  \n\nI’m not sure what to do. I want to achieve great things in life and I know I’m potentially capable of doing it (seen as I had perfect grades in middle school), but I’m just too tired to do anything right now. Everything I do seems pointless. I’m too afraid to apply to another course/school/job, because I’m afraid that no matter what I do, I don’t have the energy to succeed in it. I’m going to fail anyways. I’m going to get fired anyways. I’m afraid to take any sort of responsibility because I believe that I am incapable of sticking to it. But I can’t stop. If I stop then I won’t have any money. My family won’t support me any more and I can either become homeless or go back to my parents house (if they allow me) and become more depressed than I already am. I spent a week with them during Christmas and it only took them 3 days for them to start complaining about how I should be doing more for the family. My home country is also in the danger zone of a war, so going back there to live at the moment is not a good idea.  \n\nI have no idea what to do. I can’t see any way out of this. If I listen to my body and take a rest, then everything will fall apart. I can’t afford to do that. I have to keep moving. But I don’t know which direction to move in when all I want to do is stay still and do nothing. I’m so lost. Can anybody help? What do I do? I need to make a decision now. I can’t afford to let it wait. I have nobody to take care of me until I feel better. Nobody will want me when I’m useless. I have to provide something in order to be loved.\n",

Not even overwhelming stress can put an end to this madness, because my mind copes through sexuality. Everything is filtered through this lens.\n\nI don’t know how to stop it and I need answers quickly.\n\nEDIT: Wow, I’m honestly astonished at the huge amounts of support I’ve received from all of you.

        "body": "It sounds like you may be looking to avoid something you should be giving attention. Something inside of you is screaming to be given attention and you have been trying to mask it by other means. I suggest therapy or having a real honest conversation about yourself, with yourself?\n\nAre you angry? Sad? Confused? All of the above and plus more? These emotions need to be processed to move forward. You can do this yourself or have the help of a guide (therapist, spiritualist, woowoo specialist, whatever you want to call it). I’m sure growing up in your shoes wasn’t easy, but now you get to decide where you got from here and how you heal. Don’t give in to the self pitty and despair, know yourself and no one can tell you anything."

        "body": "It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of distress around your thoughts and feelings, which is understandably overwhelming. Acknowledging and accepting your sexuality, especially in a non-supportive environment, is a significant step and shows your strength. Your reaction could be a form of hyperfocus, possibly as a rebound from years of repression. It's important to remember that finding balance takes time, patience, and often professional support.\n\nHave you considered speaking with a therapist who's experienced in sexuality and LGBTQ+ issues? They could offer strategies tailored to you, beyond general advice. Sometimes, understanding the underlying emotions and thoughts can reduce their power. Additionally, finding a supportive community, whether it’s local or online, can provide a sense of belonging and understanding that might help mitigate the intensity of your focus on sexuality.\n\nYour journey is uniquely yours, and there's no rush to figure it all out immediately. Be kind to yourself in the process."

        "body": "Everything you are feeling is normal… or a close enough variation of normal. You’re 18. You are at your sexual peak. Your testosterone levels, if average for your age, are raging. You are going to think about sex… a lot. Couple that with the fact that you’ve never had sex, so there is that curiosity that compounds those thoughts. When I was your age (now 39M here), I would bone a fire hydrant if it made the right pass at me. \n\nYou are also dealing with repressed sexuality. That is very common with homophobic parents. But you can work through all of this. Trust me when I tell you, you are not hopeless. Far from it. It will take time. It won’t always be easy. But if you put in the work to work through it, you’ll get where you need/want to be.\n\nThree things I strongly recommend.\n\nMy first recommendation would be to get a therapist. But before you do, you have to be open to the idea of sharing your thoughts, your insecurities, your triggers, all of it with a therapist. The more you tell them, the more they can help you. You don’t have to tell them everything right off the bat. It takes time to develop a trusting relationship with your therapist, that’s normal. As long as you are good with that, you can find a reputable therapist, preferably one who specializes in helping teens/young adults in sexuality crisis.\n\nSecond recommendation- say yes to masturbation, say no to porn. The jury is still out, but a lot of studies are showing that the easy availability of endless amounts of internet porn is creating porn addiction and ruining sex for teens and young adults. Instead of watching porn, visualize what turns you on. You may not have to give up porn completely, but strictly limit how much of it you consume at the very least.\n\nThird recommendation is (and this probably will require some time working through issues in therapy) start exploring a social life that brings you into the gay community. Make friends with other young gay men. They have likely gone through what you are going through and they will be supportive of you. Who knows? You might even find a boyfriend and you’ll fall for him and he will be your first sexual experience. \n\nI went through exactly what you are going through and I wish I didn’t wait until I was in my 30’s to start truly accepting and exploring my sexuality. I lost my virginity at a young age (16) and had many sexual experiences since. I’m not bragging, just mentioning it because sex was always a source of shame for me until I reached early 30’s when I started embracing it. But I missed out on so many good years. \n\nDon’t make that mistake. Your youth should be some of your greatest years. Take advantage of it and work toward making the person you are the person you want to be."

Creative people have high sexual drives (not always true but this is an assumption). Get an outlet. \n\n2. Masturbate. It's not unhealthy and it's fine. Embrace your kinks, weirdness and whatever. It's ok...\n\n3. Embrace spirituality in some form. Our sacral chakra is usually pleasure center and held back by guilt. In simple words, find healthy outlets for pleasure and meaning. It's ok to let lose but not too much."

Not just sex, but men and the various forms they come in. Their various features. It sometimes becomes obsessive....**if I don’t exercise any executive control, it will consume me**...\n\nBuddy your exercising a form of control already and what you're feeling is you white knuckling your physical need for touch of someone your attracted to and if you can relax your grip to find a partner you will find out \n\n> ...**how to stop it.**\n\nYou have accepted the first part of your attraction, but your body is telling you it would like the touch of another and for some reason you are ignoring the signal and you are annoyed what your body is telling you instead of acknowledging you have this drive and desire to satisfy.  The way out is through my friend, you've acknowledged your gay which was a big step forward, now its time to acknowledge your body and what sex is ad your ideas related to it may be in conflict.\n\n> **I’ve tried a lot of things.** Meditation does not work. Distracting myself does not work. Filling my time with hobbies does not work. Not even overwhelming stress can put an end to this madness, because my mind copes through sexuality. Everything is filtered through this lens.\n\nYour pursuit of control and restriction and negative self judgements about sexual desires, needs and assessment of physical sensations are doing you no favors, in fact they're the things that have brought you here.  You've wound yourself up real tight and would do better if you could loosen up someone, listen to your body and respect what cues it is telling you instead of complaining the alarm is going off.  You have to acknowledge you are asserting and using self control restricting your thoughts, feelings, desires and sensations instead of embracing those feelings as something that could bring you immense physical, mental and emotional value."

My situation wasn't exactly like yours but I dealt with a similar repression.\n\nParents were supportive but I hid a lot of what I did from them, and unfortunately it was at a younger age. Had a lot of troublesome friends in my life, choice people, got involved in some areas I shouldn't have. Over time and over the years, even up until 2021/22 when I was 21 years old, I was dealing with impulsive urges that held me down.\n\nI wish I had better answers but as of new years, I just up and decided that I don't want to indulge in porn anymore. Every now and then I do, but not to the obsessive amount that I did.\n\nIt's mind over matter. If you hate it that much, just try and devalue it. Tell yourself it isn't worth it. I know it's not easy and I'm not trying to make it sound easy. Took me nearly 10 years to get that sorted. Just try and let yourself now that the indulgence isn't worth it, the way it makes you feel isn't worth it.\n\nWhat you're going through is normal, don't discount yourself. But I respect your desire to nip it in the butt early.\n\nBe kind to yourself, understand that you are valid and you are who you are, you can do this."

You may not fully realize that masturbation is a more healthy activity than watching porn, and isn't necessarily something to be concerned about.\n\nYou can't control your sexuality, you can just try to keep it from interfering with your life. 18 is pretty close to your sexual peak, it's going to be a nuisance for you sometimes."

        "body": "As far as stopping the masturbation habit, sexual release is very important for our health. I would say simply put limits on the amount of time you spend masturbating, and if there are genres of porn which you feel are not interests you would like to grow, don't watch them! A few short sessions a week, even once a day is normal for most guys, and when you have access to safe sexual partners who you feel comfortable and affectionate with, those encounters will be much more deeply satisfying than the porn sessions.\n\nI do think that your drive to explore the male form, gay sexuality, and other men's bodies in general is completely healthy and normal and probably at just the right level. Again, finding trusted partners to explore these desires with is going to do SO MUCH for your confidence and your comfort with yourself. There are a million and one ways for adults to express our sexuality and moreover, there are a million and one forms of gay intimacy that don't consist of sex at all 🙂"

You sexuality isn't a thing to be fixed nor are the signals your body is sending you, the user response needs a gentler, more empathetic interpretation.\n\nChristianity has this idea of 'original sin' that in most traditions leaves people with the fundamental take away 'I am always a broken individual' and this view point even sticks around hidden in places long after people leave the faith.  I bring this up as its a hidden boogeyman among people who leave the faith due to homophobia and the controlling culture that I feel its worth sharing if that is in fact your experience. This experience is common in conservative religious sects and their cultural influences.\n\nYou are not failing to control your sexuality because your sexuality isn't something you control more than your sensation of hunger or taste preferences, but your body is giving you signals and you are judging them very harshly and wanting your body to contort to your mind's image.  \n\nGotta loosen that mental grip man, relax and really look at who you are in reality in real time and if you can listen to how your internal voice speaks to you and try it across situations, some people really talk down to themselves in every situation, event or benign task.  \n\nIt might feel like a flood but if you take a few steps back from any situation and watch it for a few moments you might see its just its actually only several leaks that need attention. Your on your way, you just need to trust yourself and just look at thing for awhile, you just figured out your gay and whatever lead you to that repressed place has colored your world up until this point and you can repaint as needed if the view point no longer serves you or harms you on some level.\n\nOnce you free up the need to control those domains you can apply that ability to control to things that will serve you in more beneficial ways."

More things are: When I told her I couldn't hear things right she didn't believe me for over 4 months until I told my doctor at a mental health check. He referred me to an audiologist and they told me I had hearing loss. I literally fractured my hand and she didn't take me to the doctor for over a week. When I was crapping blood she waited over a year to take me in we still don’t know what’s wrong with that but she’s given up and frankly I have too. \n\nMy parents never take me seriously, none of my family does.

It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.\n\nSimple distractions can help - anything that changes your mood like beautiful music."

I am so grateful to all those who have given up their time to complete this study! I'm still trying to recruit as many people as possible throughout March, as the more datasets we have, the more reliable the findings will be, the more representative the data will be of the UK wide population, and the more confident we can be in the conclusions drawn. So please keep on completing/sharing! Thank you! Please see all the information below.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHi everyone,\n\n  \nMy name is Melanie Taylor and I'm a trainee clinical psychologist at Lancaster University in the UK.  \nI'm doing a research project for my doctorate thesis investigating the relationship between childhood trauma and self-concept clarity (that is, having a clear sense of who you are as a person). I'm also looking to see how self-defining memories play a role.\n\n  \n**Who can take part?**  \nParticipants must be:\n\n* UK residents\n* Fluent in English\n* At least 21 years old\n* AND identify as having experienced at least one traumatic event before 18 years of age.\n\nAn event which is traumatic includes any experience which you found very stressful, frightening or distressing.\n\n  \nThis may have involved:\n\n* Experiencing or witnessing aggression, violence, emotional or sexual abuse\n* Experiencing or witnessing accident or injury\n* Experiencing illness or someone close to you experiencing illness\n* Loss or bereavement\n* Parental separation\n* Experiencing bullying\n* Natural disaster\n* Living through and/or escaping conflict\n\nThis list is not full - you may have experienced something else which you found traumatic.\n\n  \n**What does the study involve?**  \nThe study is entirely online and takes about 10-15 mins to complete. If you decide to take part, you will be asked to type out a childhood memory in a paragraph, and complete three questionnaires. Please type the memory out in the text box if you are able to.  \nYou are free to withdraw at any time without penalty or having to give a reason.\n\n# [Click here to go to the study.](https://bit.ly/48eE9vJ) \n\n  \n**Please make sure you read all the information and instructions fully and carefully before taking part.**\n\n  \nI will end recruitment in April 2024. Once it is ready, I will share a summary of the findings on this post, and also on my X and instagram research pages u/Melanie_ClinPsy.  \nI'm also hoping to publish the findings in an academic peer reviewed journal, and that it will help influence further research into understanding the psychological impact of experiencing childhood trauma.  \nThank you so much to everyone for your support, I'm incredibly grateful for your time!  \nIf you have any questions or queries, please email me at M.Taylor14@lancaster.ac.uk  \nThis study has been given ethical approval by Lancaster University FHM Research Ethics Committee.  \n",

        "body": "Context: We met 8 months ago on a dating app. Started dating immediately cause we hit it off so there wasn't really time for us to woo each other. \n\nHe (26m) is funny and very very sweet. But it's the same silly repetitive jokes now that both of us make to eachother. There's lack of effort.\n\nToday we were looking at our Instagram archives, and I noticed that he was so funny and interesting up till a year ago. He was more active on his socials, went out more, had intelligent jokes, etc. \n\nWhen he talks about his ex from college (they dated for 3 years) he says that it was the purest most fun period of his life falling in love with her. He also clarifies that by the end he didn't like her but still. I feel so much FOMO and jealousy that he doesn't feel as much for me. Of course he was a teenager then, and it was his first long term relationship, but still. He had so many stories and posts with her. His jokes were really funny and he had a stronger personality. He was someone I would have a crush on.\n\nHe doesn't do any of those things with me though. He jokingly says that all his online activity was to woo women but i don't know. He used to meet people often, had a happening life, read more, enjoy his job. Now he doesn't like his job, just meets me in the name of socialisation, plays video games for relaxation. He is taking therapy for work dissatisfaction and I am not complaining about him being a bad boyfriend to me. After all I didn't need to woo him either. I just want to feel more impressed with him. And I want to want to impress him too. I really miss the chase.. we never had that. I tried it initially, tried to woo him, but didn't see extra effort from his side so I stopped. \n\nI have started to feel like I leeched out all the joy from his life (I am clinically depressed). I try to tell myself that it's not true, but I don't know. Maybe I only attract people when they are not doing well in life cause I'm not doing so well in life. This is making me feel really horrible about myself and I don't know what to do to feel otherwise. Is it even fair of me to think this way?",

I’m on 150 mg bupropion and 20 mg Escitalopram. \n\nMy anxiety is manageable but the depression seems to have just worn me down over time.\n\nI was still okay and managing up until this summer I moved an hour thirty away from work and did the drive for two months cause I couldn’t find a new job.\n\nRight as I found a new job, my apartment was shot up by a neighbor across the hall and an assailant.\n\nWe were okay, but this just broke me cause I needed to move again and it was dangerous, but more importantly I had to spend money to move again right after I was already fucked financially from the last move.\n\n\nI don’t think I ever let go of the shooting and the trauma, but I haven’t been able to see a psych or anything for 2 years due to the stupid limits of availability.\n\n\nAnyhow, then I got a job with a pos boss that just constantly talked down to me and gave me shit work.\nThey let me go at the end of the 6 months due to being late.\n\nI get it, but I just have lost all motivation.\n\n\nI struggle with getting up on time, Cleaning, taking care of myself.\n\nI can’t find another job due to lack of education (due to lack of finances when I was younger.)\n\n\n\n\nI’m not going to lie to anyone; I have caused my own problems, but I really can’t be motivated enough to fix anything and I feel it’s my mental health.\n\n\nI just need a few recommendations;\n\n1. Is there ANYTHING I can do to financially support myself for a month or two while I work on myself?\n\n2. If not, does anyone have a suggestion for work that would be accommodating to my issues in the meantime? \n\n3. How could I go about talking to SOMEONE to give me a better understanding of this mental shit? I mean Doctors just medicate and barely pay attention. I can’t get a psychiatry or psychologist appointment for another 7 months, so what do I do???\n\n\nI don’t know if this is burnout, some form of like ADHD (a lot of my family has it, but docs always say it’s not likely), but I definitely relate to the term Executive Dysfunction.\n\n\nI WANT to do things, but I can’t.\n\nI have barely any support system.

People may think its lazyness, but its just no motivation or needing some alone time...\n\nTry to get your head free again. Maybe try an old hobby you had as a kid but gave up to. Or a new hobby? Maybe making music, writing a novel. Making any kind of art like drawing? Or just, read a book. \n\nIve started months ago going for alone walks at night. The dark, empty but slightly lightfull streets are relaxing. Listening to music and just walking for hours. Sometimes I just walk for 5+ hours or more. Sometimes ill take a novel and read it while im outside. Very calming and relaxing.\n\nI bet you can find other strangers, in the internet, to write with. I know, stranger danger, but trust me. Its way more comfortable to chat with randoms than talking woth people you know. Sometimes i think irl people just dont understand us, they cannot give us good advices or even listen to us to the full end. But you know? The internet is big. There will always be someone that can feel like you, that makes actions like you, that maybe have the same routine like you. Even when its hard to find someone, there will be a light at the end of the dark void you may feel sometimes. \nFeel free to dm anyone in this comment section, im also always ready to chat!"

        "body": "If you’ve ever had a toothache or been in pain, the relief that you feel when you get it sorted out is overwhelming. Simple things like eating a meal or going for a walk are suddenly a joy. The sky is even more blue, the birds are chirping even more brightly, it even seems like the trees are waving to you. Hmm, maybe the anasthestic from the dentist hasn’t worn off yet.\n\nThe point is, when you get over a difficult experience like toothache or doing a test or a job interview, it feels great to be alive. And the insight is that this feeling is accessible to you in every moment, all day every day. And the way that we access that is through gratitude.\n\nGratitude can sometimes feel like a formality, like when your aunt buys you socks for Christmas. But its more than a social box that you tick when someone does something for you. Taking some time every day to feel grateful for the things in your life that make a difference means that you start feeling joy in everything. And yes - that can be your house, your family and your health. The big obvious stuff.\n\nWhere you can really transform your mental health is feeling gratitude for the small stuff and the everyday things that you don’t notice. Like your breath - you can feel gratitude for an inbreath and an outbreath. You can feel grateful for your body, like your hands, your legs, your arse. The chair your arse is on.\n\nThere’s a great video by Kurtzgesagt on how gratitude is the one common trait between happy people. Those who are thankful for what they have rather than pining for what they don’t live much happier lives. \n\nSo how do we practise gratitude in a way where its lifting our mood? One of the simplest and most effective ways to engage in a gratitude practice is to smile. We may not always feel like smiling, but its a physical expression of gratitude that can lift our spirits and remind us of the positive aspects of our lives.  I, sadly have one of those resting grumpy faces so it does take quite a bit of concentration for me but it genuinely does makes a difference - there’s lots of evidence to show that smiling produces a measurable improvement to your mood.\n\nAnd as the day comes to a close, taking time to reflect on the events and experiences of the day is another crucial aspect of gratitude practice. Consider what went well and what you are thankful for. It may be the laughter shared with a friend, the progress made on a project, or a beautiful sunset. Pick one big joy, like a family member, one little joy like your last meal and one neutral thing you wouldn’t normally notice like your hands. \n\nGratitude is a transformative practice that can help us recognise the amazing aspects of our mundane lives. Smiling at the things and people we are grateful for, saying thank you to our loved ones, savouring the small moments in our daily routines, and reflecting on our daily experiences all contribute to a greater sense of contentment and happiness. By cultivating a gratitude practice, we can shift our focus from what we don’t have to what we do have. \n\n[Listen for more](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-secret-to-being-happy-minecraft-and-mindfulness/id1725994305?i=1000648170880)",

        "body": "My I guess now ex girlfriend is just in a horrible place mentally. She gets massive mood swings and I can't handle everything alone especially as an autistic who has his own serious problems. I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts myself but with the little hope I have I am hanging in there also knowing I could never let my little sister lose his brother. But her situation is a lot worse. She has an history of SH and she attempted to end it once since we got together. We normally have a really great relationship I could almost say perfect. We get along really well normally and even when she breaks down without the huge mood swing we spend some time together sometimes cuddling sometimes dreaming about our future and it really helps her. But when the mood swings hit or I don't even know if they are mood swings at this point maybe they are something completely different and more serious, she just becomes a different person. She becomes rude, satirical, impossible to reason with, basically someone I would never wanted to be with. I still try to be as nice as possible to her and try to calm her down a bit but she just gets provoked from everything I say. During these periods she becomes extremely suicidal and always talks about how much she wants to die. She also attempted on one of these periods before. She got a huge mood swing again 5 days ago. We were just fine by the morning, talking about how we want out future house to look like just hours later she was crying and saying she wants to break up with me and I learn a day after she wants to break up with me because she wants to die and she doesn't want that to affect me. I do everything I can to try to convince her otherwise while not provoking her but she gets angry and tells me that I am trying to fix her just because I told her there are a lot of other ways than death. I don't even know how she thinks I am trying to fix her I absolutely have no idea what I did wrong. Then we argue and I try to take a step back. Then she texts me again saying that I didn't talk to her much for the last two days and she tells me that I don't care about her?? I just didn't want to provoke her more accidentally that's all. I am going to say again she is absolutely not a person like this without the mood swings. She is the sweetest person I have ever met. I don't know what happens to her and it kills me. She blocked me this morning. Yes just 5 days after we were planning how our future house was going to look like. And I wished her a better and happier life before she blocked me. She responded with Lol yeah Goodbye and blocked me. I genuinely don't understand what I should have done to prevent things from escalating. If there is anyone here who went through a similar thing as her I would love to talk for a bit and try to understand her a bit more. Even if we don't get back together I at least want to know where I went wrong so I don't repeat my mistakes again and lose another person that I care about",

For the last two years or so, I have struggled with an ED which has affected every part of my life and relationships. I went from an overweight person to struggling with an ED while still not being incredibly skinny. No one will help me because I am not skin and bones yet. I have faced a serious mental decline, especially in the last 3 months. I can barely get out of bed, brush my teeth, shower, eat, leave the house, etc. I need to take time off from college due to this but I do not have the energy to anything, let alone figure how to withdraw from my classes. It’s gotten to the point that my main support system has now told me I’m not allowed around her children until I can get better. I feel so broken. Never in my life have I felt more worthless and a disappointment. I am friends with my manager and she let me know that my job won’t be able to accommodate me being sick, unwell, missing work anymore and I completely understand. I had covid and influenza a consecutively the last few weeks that contributed to me missing a lot of stuff and a further decline in my mental stability. I am completely at a loss of what to do. I am buried in student loans, unwell with mystery illnesses that I haven’t been able to get myself to get care for, and a constant battle with major depressive disorder. I think it may be time for an inpatient stay or something of the sort. I feel like I constantly have to defend myself, as my parent genuinely believes that none of these issues are real. If anyone has any advice, I would seriously appreciate it. ",

There's a number of good things, most of them surprisingly easy.\n\nGood motivation can be a game changer. It gives you confidence. It lets you get important things done.\n\nStudents often say that the information I give here is helpful -\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/17y92bf/how\\_do\\_i\\_ask\\_my\\_mom\\_to\\_take\\_me\\_to\\_see\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/17y92bf/how_do_i_ask_my_mom_to_take_me_to_see_a/)\n\nAs the first video shows, teenagers with anorexia have done much better with family-based treatment than with individual therapy with office visits.\n\nI'll mention that there's another treatment that's often successful - DBT (video 2). Therapists sometimes use methods from DBT. A version called RO (radically open) DBT has been shown to help with anorexia.\n\nAs this article explains, studies show that relaxation methods help with anorexia, although of course you have to be extremely careful about exercise, as this is usually part of the problem. \n\n[https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/blog/the-benefits-of-relaxation-training-in-anorexia-recovery](https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/blog/the-benefits-of-relaxation-training-in-anorexia-recovery)\n\nAbout relaxation, the research on controlled breathing is amazing. A study with war veterans convinced the VA to recommend this for vets with PTSD. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPyiddgWlfE&t=115s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPyiddgWlfE&t=115s)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Stz--d17ID4&t=33s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Stz--d17ID4&t=33s)\n\nDBT - an excellent therapy for behavior problems - recommends a number of coping methods, including paced breathing.\n\nA very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK."

I’ve thought about this before but I guess I was distracted, since recently I went through a break up and what made me feel worse with that is i never even got closure she just left without saying anything, have money problems and in a new place with minimal friends. And any friends I do have it feels like they’re always busy, which ofc I can’t blame them for.\n\nI’m thankfully not incapacitated because of these, so I’m still working and studying but any achievement I get feels worthless. Maybe because nothing significant has come out of them yet, one day they might add up to something but I guess I feel like I’m in a “filler episode” loool.\n\nThen once I do get those achievements then what? Does it really have any meaning? Any achievement I’ve got so far I’m glad I got it done but now I need something new to distract myself with it’s crazy.\n\nLike overall the thing is if I do get any of my issues solved, it feels like tools of distracting me, like say I find more friends, I’ll distract myself for a few hours a day and then what? \n\n\n",

That was 2021, now I'm engaged to the woman of my dreams, we have our own place, we have two rescue dogs, and work in the same company; still have the credit card debt though.\n\nA lot of people will tell you to find a faith to believe in yo help you recover, for some that works. Some people will tell you to find a hobby to get you motivated. My office has several shelves of tank and warship models. I read through the Bible several times, i tried hobbies, and just couldn't get the inspiration to get up and kick life's ass and get back at it. I went as far as motivational music remixes on YouTube and started sparring on and off at little gym in town (I kinda made my brain think about it kinda like the 2011 movie Warrior as my motivation, made some okay money in some bets but took a lot of beatings)\n\nIt might be religion, it might be hobbies, it might motivational music or motivation speakers (a lot of really good ones out there and a lot of bad) or it could be getting into a gym.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that there will be something that pops in your head one day that will begin to pull you up out of the spiral you're in. The downward spiral will break sooner than you believe. And you'll start to rise up and kick life's ass back for what it's put you through."

        "body": "I'm sick and tired of suffering. I've been suffering my whole life and I keep suffering every day. I don't even care if anyone is going to read that shit, since it's gonna be way too long, I just need to get this off my chest.\n\n\nI was born by selfish and reckless parents. My dad was an alchoholic (not an abusive one). And my mother is the worst piece of shit I've ever known. Both my parents were stupid and wanted to live their dream, which was: Have a house, have jobs, have a kid... etc. But they didn't want no fucking kid. They wanted the dream. So when that dream fell aparat I was left broken. My mother cheated on my dad, he took her back, but started cheating on her too. He started working in different towns/cities/countries, and used to cheat on her many times, so she ended up moving in with the guy she was fucking. I refused to live with them since I blamed the guy for ruining my family, but he was an okay guy now that I think of it. So while my dad was fucking hoes and my mother started building that \"second dream\" I was left alone in the house, so I had to take care of myself since I was 11 years old. My dad came back to live with me since he got sick from the fake alchohol he was drinking years later. He was everything I had left, until he died when I was 15. My mother's bf died as well (before my dad).\n\n\nMy mother aways tried to use me and take the small amount of money I had (in my country, the goverment pays you a little amount of money if you have a dead parent). She tried to manupulate and gaslight me into giving her money. She used to abuse me physicly, but the mental part fucked me up for life.\n\n\nI have severe social anxiety, and regular anxiety. My hair went grey like a mf in my mid twenties, because of that. My eye is constantly twitching, and I can't talk to people or deal with situations that cause conflict. I used to fight a lot in school, but at one point I stopped so I got bullied almost every day. \n\nRn I'm studying for a teacher, and I have a similar situation. Since in my class? (idk how to call it) I get treated like shit by my colleagues. And most of them are female, so I can't really do anything I can just talk, since if I raise my voice, threaten or even touch them (which they do btw), I will end up being the bad guy and it will destroy my entire life. (In my country if you get into trouble you won't be able to work as a teacher for the rest of your life).\n\n\nI don't even know if I want to be a teacher anymore. I was aways anti-social. I just love playing video games all day long, read stuff about science, and go camping from time to time. But I just despise human interaction. Most my teachers like me tho so idk what I'm doing wrong with other people.\n\nNow many people are gonna say \"don't be a teacher\", well the thing is I didn't really have good grades in high school so my odds of getting accepted into a different college aren't that high. On top of that... I need a job that will pay good money, and I will find one pretty easy. A teacher fits this description very well (at least in my country). But I just don't know what to do. I have a spouse which tries to be supportive, but It's just not enough. And it's not their problem... It's in me. I'm the damn problem.\n\n\nI'm a slave to anxiety, social anxiety, but I also suffer from paranoia and phobias. My whole life is just suffering, having something that makes me feel good happens rarely. The only thing that keeps me sane are video games.\n\n\nDoctors won't help, since their goal is to get me addicted to pills so they can milk money from me. (It really is that bad where I live) I have no money, and almost everything I feel in my life is suffering. I just don't think there is a way out for me. I don't know if I want to live, I don't know if I want to die. I don't know if all that struggle in my college is worth it. I just don't know what to fucking do.\n\n\nI'm also struggling with sleep. I haven't had a good sleep in years. I just want to sleep good at least once more.",

I feel like I can't have anything nice now because I'm just worthless and don't deserve happiness. I feel hopeless. The only thoughts in my mind right now are 'Why them and not me?', 'what did I do wrong' and 'why is it never me'. I don't like myself right now.\n\n I only have my marks to back me up. Those aren't even THAT great too. I don't have the looks, I don't have sports I don't have other extra currics. Nothing. While my cladsmates do. Well, one in particular. I love that classmate. She's a good friend of mine, and she's a genuinely good person. Because of that, I hate the jealousy I feel towards her. I can't help it anymore. I feel like shes better than me and so whenever I hear that she didn't get something great, I feel better. I can't help it. I try not to, because I'm aware of how shitty that is. I always try being positive with her, congratulating her, joking around, being in a good mood etc. but I can't help but feel sad, and angry. Not really at her, but at myself. \n\nIf anyone wants to message me, please don't. I don't accept private dms.",

As for well... suicidal thoughts and that thing was nearly attempted twice. I'm just going to start from the start. I'm 13M, nearly 14. I go to a school where I do subjects 1 year ahead of me, because I took a few tests. I'm also doing two subjects, computing and Latin, where I do it two years ahead of me. It's really stressful, and even when I've talked to someone like my parents, they basically just tell me to get on. I have autism, so I really struggle to just \"get to know\" people, and my mood swings are really really heavy on me. For example, just one teacher giving me a verbal warning can upset me for 5-10 minutes, and that's one of the reasons I just struggle. As well as this, bullies just pick me up as a prime target for bullying, because I struggle to hide my emotions and my autism seems to just carry characteristics of children. Eg: I collect and talk about pokemon over and over.  This basically has caused me to be bullied for now 4 years in a row... and it just feels exhausting. Being bullied and then having to deal with your parents not even helping you when you have serious problems with school anyways. Then, around a year ago my grand-father passed. He's the first person who I know who's died, except one person who took their own life I'd say a year or two ago. And I've just had lasting mental health issues since. I just don't know if I'm over reacting because of my autism, where even my friends haven't cared about me when I want to do this stuff... I just feel like really alone, and Isolated. I've tried to talk to a therapist, that my school arranged, but it just didn't work. I feel like in the nights the only things I can think about are sadness, darkness and just overall bad things. I just don't know if I'm over reacting or if anyone out there even really, truly cares.",

        "body": "  A lot will be said here and it's going to be a mess since I've been in constant stress that I can't even afford to continue my maintenance and sessions monthly. I could barely get a psychologist and I've stopped medication for more than a year now. (Trigger Warning: mention of harming at the end)\n\n   Lately I've been mentally and physically drained due to relationship and work. Though my relationship is currently on a break so right now the stress is majority about work. \n\n   It takes me more than 2hrs to commute to work, and that's only one way. So it takes me around 5hrs a day just for traveling. I wish I could move closer to work but my salary is the same price or lower than a studio unit near my work location. I could learn to drive the motorcycle but even that stresses me out since I failed to get a license for it back then. I tend to call my work \"dystopian\". The work location is beautiful but the food prices are so expensive it'll cost me nearly 1/3 of my day salary. Because of all this it stresses me out that yes the place and benefits are great but I can't fucking afford to live there so I have to live far away.\n\n  Benefits are great and it feels like a safe environment but there are times that I feel like there's still stigma about my disability. When I open up about my mental illness, there's a lack of understanding or sometimes I feel invalidated. Words like \"We also have problems\", \"Don't take those medicines\", \"I prefer when people smile despite their problems\" etc...\n\n   The thing that is slowly killing me right now is that I feel like my work is getting micro-managed sometimes and how vague the given tasks can be. I tend to do things according to previous requests and when I do there's still problems. I'm one of the creatives so the mind is doing all the work to translate their vision into visuals but its hard to work on things when there's nothing to or barely anything to work with. So every time there's change needed and I do it, its a hit or miss. \n\n   Now I'm contemplating if I can even handle the corporate world. Thinking of quitting and pick a more menial job so I can shift my creativity focus on my stuff for enjoyment and not for someone else's. Since I can't handle it anymore trying to always be productive only to fall on deaf ears. They see it, they like it but they move on quickly. while creating products they can't even deliver. \n\n   I forgot to mention, the stress is so bad that whenever my chest aches I become suicidal and wanna stab my chest or slice my arms. I don't do it because of past beliefs that got ingrained in my head but its slowly getting there since I'm starting to glide the utility knife on my arms creating light cuts. I badly wanna go back to taking my medication but it costs so much and the withdrawals is so bad when I can't afford it again.",

        "body": "\nFor context; I grew up in an insanely religious household & my relatives / extended family are all very much ride or die for religion, but I never followed it, in fact, their constant push of it in a very agressive way and equating it with morals and \"burning in hell if you don't pray\" etc. really drove me away from it further. I have never prayed, never cared for religion, also being queer, and more open minded / for general things they'd oppose, I've steered clear of religion. I've identified as atheist for a while, before going to agnostic. \n\nRecently though, I've been feeling so down. Life feels another level of fucked up, and over, and dark. I am so lonely. I have no hope for the future, something I always had (even when I'd have my depressive moments) and i wake up everyday with a physical pain in my chest from the sadness and loneliness. I've often thought about praying; in case lack of belief and faith may be the reason for all these hardships and tough feelings (cause after years of trying to push it on you, some of the things people say sticks/makes you feel guilty...it's a what if of \"what if my life is shit cause god is punishing me for not believing in him or praying etc.\").. I feel though it would be selfish to just pray and ask for things and turn to \"god\" just to so I can ask for better but not 100%, turn to \"god\" cause I still wouldn't be religious, and i fairly recently scoffed and eye rolled at my cousin who told me my depression would go away if i prayed. I'm just looking for any way out of this dark feeling. But I also don't want to do something wrong / be selfish with praying, in case God or some higher power does exist. At the same time, I dont wanna waste my time and energy learning something (because I have to learn particular steps and prayers etc).(and it is already impossible to get out of bed, and as I mentioned I'm agnostic so I'm 50/50 on it all; if it doesn'twork out for me then i just waste energy and time and hope, and i feel it would hurt me more)\n\nI'm just asking if anyone here who didn't really follow a faith but in dark times found solitude in faith? I know its a personal thing, i just feel conflicted. Any opinions are welcome. I've never been religious. I've prided myself on being different to my family, because i am; and it would feel like a compromise of myself and who I've always been and fought for. But I'm also so fucking depressed and empty, I need something. My cousins always talk about this peace, they're very young so I don't know. Maybe it's the placebo or maybe its real..I am not sure.\n",

I mainly feel super depressed from around 9am till 3pm ish and then happy in the evening for some reason. When I am in a depressed mood I feel like I hate working, want to quit and wonder the meaning of it all. But when I am in a good mood I enjoy my mundane job and want to seek out more work. I have had a history of anxiety and depression since high school but I have had it under control for a few years, to the point where it was very mild. I have been taking an antidepressant at a fairly low dose for around 5-6 years now. I believe that I have a very good life and no reason to feel this way, I should be happy and grateful for the position I am in. I have a wonderful loving family that I can tell anything, a great girlfriend of 4 years, lots of friends, no financial struggles, and now I have a great internship at a great company. \n\nA few reasons I think this may be occurring:\n\n- I quit nicotine about 3 months ago\n- Recently discovered I might have sleep apnea\n- Maybe a deficiency in some sort of vitamin \n- A scared feeling towards becoming an adult \n- Existential crisis maybe\n- Seasonal Depression perhaps (Winter in Canada)\n\nWhat would y’all recommend? \n\n",

        "body": "I have four close family members who, over the course of the past year, have developed severe physical/mental/financial problems or had these issues resurface. I am their main or only source of emotional support and I care about them deeply, but I am beginning to feel like I cannot do this anymore.\n\nNot too long ago I suffered from severe depression and burnout myself, and I have only recently begun to feel like my old self again - I am happier and calmer than I have been in years, but at the same time I'm acutely aware that my own mental health is still quite fragile. \n\nWhile two of the aforementioned four family members have always had severe issues, this was manageable and somewhat mitigated by the other two. Now, however, all of them are struggling and are turning to me in search of support. I dread answering my phone because talking to them has become so bleak and leaves me feeling drained and unhappy, like I'm surrounded by this ocean of human misery. Sometimes I feel like they only call me to vent, dump all their frustration and pain at my feet, and hang up again - only to then complain about how I never tell them anything about my life or call them up just to chat anymore. I am in my mid-twenties and while I would love to help them get better, the issues they are facing are exclusively things beyond my control. \n\nI don't want to cut them out of my life, but it seems like the only things we are talking about now are death, pain, misery, and sorrow, and I feel like I risk being sucked back into the pit of despair I just escaped from myself. This is made worse by the fact that I feel like I cannot possibly turn to them for help should I need it, as they are all struggling so hard themselves - like everyone is leaning on me for emotional support, but I have no one who is there for me. It gets especially hard for me when they say things like \"I'm so glad to have you!\", \"you are the only one who understands\", etc. I feel trapped as two of them have quite literally no one else to turn to but me.\n\n**How can I become more resilient and be less affected by my loved one's problems?** I want to stay in regular contact with them, but I find it very difficult to disengage from what they tell me and carry on with my own day after we hang up. What would healthy boundaries in this case potentially look like?\n\nAny recommendations for books on this topic would also be much appreciated. \n\nThank you for reading.",

        "body": "Summary questions:\n1)Do I have abandonment issues?\n2) Can this be a reason to have abandonment issues?\n3) How do I fix it and how to reach out to my partner when anxious?\n\n I have been dealing with social anxiety which started around the age of 12, even tjough now I've pretty much overcome it. A while ago I hot into my first relationship, which is going really well but I have realized that I sometimes get very anxious about losing my partner because of the slightest reasons (more precisely I'm sometimes akward due to the social anxiety and in a moment when it hits it makes me believe that he won't want to be with someone like me, I get really anxious which causes a loop of bad emotions etc.) \n\nToday when something similar occured I realized this happed before with all people - when I did something stupid or even slightly bad I always fell into overthinking and believing that others will hate me. I have always managed to deal with it through some alone time and realizing it's irational and if they did they're not worth it, unfortunately I can't do that now because fhe thought of losing my partner isn't what I want.\nBut it also made me realize that I migh have abandonment issues.\n\nAnd the cause of them is mainly my mum. I have never been abused or had any trauma or problems like needing to take care of younger sibling. But still, except for when I was little (cca until age of 7) I never really depended on my mum emotionally. I never shared my problems with friends, boys, fears etc. or many other things. For example when I got my first period we never talked about it, she got to know whrn I was telling a doctor at an appointment. I never felt quite comfortable with telling her these things and we are quite different in many ways.\n\nAdditionally my mum has also some mental issues - moodswings, probably slight deppresion, which often cause her being angry and yell. It 's not that serious but when it happens as often as it does it's really draining. And now I at least know how to deal with it, when I was younger I didn't understand it and tried to fight back resulting in often fights.\n\nNext problem which is problem in my whole family is that we don't know how to deal with arguments. When it happends it's resolved by waiting, almost never is something talked through and I think it's very hard to deal with arguments because of that for me (I usually try to avoid them) and also because of both reasons it's hard to cummunicate my needs in relationship or reach out to my partner even if I want to.\n\nSo my question is if this all makes even sense? Could be this a reason to have abandonment issues and do I have them? If yes what can I do to improve and communicate better? \n\nThank you for reading throught these paragraphs. Especially with how long it got. I will be gratefull for anx comment or advice :)\n",

First we are going to watch a Barbie marathon which is cool because these were my favorite movies as a kid, but the point is they are all my friends friends. I don't know any of them. And I have a tough time getting along with girls. I have specific sense of humour, I'm INTJ, and have specific hobbies. I'm afraid I'm not going to get along with them or I will be awfully uncomfortable. I have some girl-friends but they are similair to me - they don't get along with most of other women. It is hard for me because I wish it was different. I don't know what to talk about with them and when we do talk it's, I would say, shallow? So I am really afraid of tomorrow, especially that I saw some screenshots of those girls gc convo and I can clearly say they are not the type I would be easily getting along with.\n\nSome advices how to approach this party tomorrow so I don't stress that much? I was thinking maybe I should drink something before the party so I can be more open and joyfull, or maybe I shouldn't go at all, but this would dissapoint my friend.",

There's nothing to worry about. Obviously, this is very shallow and from a neutral perspective. I don't know how you are feeling, but just try not to think about it at all. For me, it's a lot easier if I just go with the flow rather than prepare myself for something I find scary. The more you think, the more you second guess yourself. Just go with the flow. You are who you are, and yeah, no one is perfect. Anyways, out of all the advice I can give, the most important thing is that you do go to the party. If you don't go, those feelings will come back in the future, and you won't get over those feelings. I hope this helps!"

        "body": "My Sweet Melissa Bee\n\nIf any of what you said holds truth.\nWe couldn't share a love, neither of us were able.\nWe both were toxic to each other and it affected everyone around us. You admitted to manipulating me. I at the time wasn't even aware what a \"love-bomb\" was. You admitted to cheating. And there's those out there who seem to believe otherwise. But that don't me Melssa. I told you after the mental breakdown. It pointed me to Self love and healing. We both know I'm an empath. You said and know I'm gifted, a natural healer. Even said no other man or person in your life provided my safety and security. Your daughter said I was the best thing for your soul. How your eyes lit up. How happy you were when I came around. But it had to end and turn ugly because that's part of the cycle. I accept that. That's alright by me. I understand. \nWe shared a bond through Trauma and don't seem meir mature enough and able to  face it.  Both parties are to blame. One no more than the other.. I'm aware of the hurtful things I said. You reeled me back in 3 times. September-February. We Even began talking marriage. Smh lol. Asked me to move in, and kicked me out twice within 2 weeks  And sadly I feel you put most of the blame on me. But that doesn't bother me. WHAT DOES sadden me though is that you're still doing it to everyone around you. I just told you 15 minutes ago that there's an negative force now in your life that won't allow you to heal,  to grow and experience all those wonderful things you speak of. And I'm aware that you're on an old recycled supply. Uhh, BoBandy Jee we'll call him.  Who you said was physically abusive. And you just kept around for financial stability. And that you left because he was a \"Man-Child\" who played with little toys and the multiple times you cheated on him. And the hundreds of dollars of his money we spent on food, etc. And your 3 way relationship with your 2 good friends(no longer the female friend) went awry because of the sexual parts of it. You are so caught up trying to run game on EVERYONE,  ONES YOU SAY YOU LOVE that you don't even remember what you all tell people. BoBandy don't deserve another round of this Melssa. What, we say,  3 weeks??  Find it in your heart,  somewhere to do pepple so dirty. You said yourself if he knew what you were up to he wouldn't be happy and be there. Did he not recognize your infamous \"love-bomb\"? Must've not since you just manipulated him with hours of sex. You're not slick. At all.\nI've been praying for you, he knows I have and that's why our paths crossed once again. I told you I would walk away, probably more than once.  But  I will always stop. Turn around, come back and offer you my loving and helping hand.\nYou asked me no matter how many times you fucked up.  How far you pushed me away. Not to every give up on you. And that we would always have the deepest connection you've ever felt. We had a pull. And that's because again, I'm an empath. I \"snatch\" souls. Ones that are meant to. \nI  pray a day you feel safe to where you can face your traumas and possibly heal. Maybe you need that reality check and be put on the path of self love and healing as you did to me.  And I've never been more grateful. Maybe instead of seeking a revenge or get back. Maybe I can return the love of allowing you to grow and not hide from life and  yourself. \n   Forever and Always,\n                                  RxcHRD. \n",

        "author": "Rosesnlillies",
        "timestamp": "2024-03-06T18:03:50",
        "body": "Hi everyone, just wanted to share my story. I (36F) have known my now ex husband (38M) for 12 years and have been married to him for 6. In the past month he developed a psychosis and I tried everything I could to get him the proper help he needed. He refused and began to see me as his enemy. We were in a happy marriage which is why it came as a complete shock when on the 21st of February he told me in front of his father that he wanted a divorce. He refused to give a reason but when I kept asking he said that the feelings are gone and the trust is gone. I asked him why and if I could do anything to change that he said no my decision is final. I pleaded for him to reconsidered because I did not want him to make such a final decision at a moment where he is mentally unwell. We are Muslims and when a man verbally divorces his wife there is a 3 month reconciliation period where you still live together and can reconcile. After 3 months the divorce is irrevocable. My ex said that I am supposed to live with him in the same house, in different portions and we will keep our distance , but I cannot leave the house and if I don't find any other place to live afterwards, I can rent the lower portion of the house. I freaked out and I packed my most important stuff in a hurry and went to my mother's house. The night after I came to my mother's house, my ex came around at 1.30 and threw in a window. He threw metal rods & wooden planks over the wall and yelled that im a whore. We called the police but didnt file a report yet. I never wanted to leave him, especially not during an illness. there was a lot of love between us. I do think however that he was planning this divorce beforehand because he had the presence of mind to do it in front of his father (a witness is required. ) I excused all this behaviour due to his illness, but he went too far. I talked to his dad recently and his dad kind of blamed me saying I should have stayed at the house and he is advising me to sweep everything under the rug. My ex husband doesnt bother to keep in touch and is going on lavish spending sprees. He hasn't gone to work in over a month. The reason why I think it's bipolar vs any other condition is because one day he feels on top of the world and other days severely depressed.  I have talked to my (ex)husband 3x and he admitted that he remembers everything and is apologetic and said that evil voices in his head were telling him to divorce me and that the voiced said I'm a bad woman and that's why he vandalised the house. He said Satan had tempted him the day he divorced me but that it will never happen again coz he is over that episode now. I said you need treatment and you can't guarantee me that it won't happen again coz it's not in your control. I asked or actually pleaded him to go to the doctor with me and he refused. He said he is open to help but not medication. I think at this point we both realised our marriage was over. The lack of accountability from his side is hurtful. He would rather loose this marriage than get help.  We are supposed to have a call on Saturday but I don't think it's much of a use. I wanted to know, was I wrong to demand he gets help? He has demonstrated that he is capable of physically attacking me. He wants me to come back home and just see how it goes while I want him to consider treatment before I even think of returning.",

Anyone who shows too much joy is being “dramatic” according to my mom. I was on a trip with friends on my dad’s birthday and I had all my friends sing happy birthday to him on the phone. Instead of being appreciative, he made some sarcastic remark about how they can’t sing. They are hateful, they judge everyone, they’re not willing to learn or do anything new. I love them. But I don’t like them. Trust me, I feel immense guilt about that. But now as a 35 year old female in therapy, I know that my issues stem from them. I learned what I know from them. My low self esteem, my difficulties with friendships, my inability to get really close to anyone (even my husband) all stems from the lack of emotion or joy or warmth that I needed growing up. But now I need re-learn and I don’t know how. I’m just sad a lot of the time. And I want to be happy. ",

I read this and felt like I was reading a description of my own parents (more so my father).\n\nI (39M) also have come to the realization that a lot of my issues stem from having an emotionally void father with zero social/emotional intelligence. My mother is more normal but it kills me how she enables him and it brings her down. My older sister and I have very similar issues as a result and we have both been in therapy. Our therapists, independent of each other, have made very similar conclusions about my parents and their personality profiles. \n\nIt really is difficult being in your late 30’s and realizing that you need to re-learn so much of what was considered normal in your upbringing. We will get there eventually but I have the feeling it’s a long haul. I don’t want to blame them forever. And I don’t want them to part this earth with me having created this distance between myself and them. I think therapy helps. But we have to work at it. Good luck to you."

This is the scary and exciting part, now you get to put all those new theories into practice. Overcoming habits even mental patterns is one of the most challenging things because as you stated it’s forcing the body to relearn how to respond. \n\nI encourage you to find support, a psychologist will be able to understand the past trauma and help you on a path to achieving your goals.

        "body": "Sorry to hear about your situation and glad to hear you are going to therapy to help over come this part of you. I know it is difficult and resolving these issues take a long time to overcome. I also started to try to improve my self during my 30's and have some advice that helped me. One of the big ones and most difficult was improving my positive self talk. In my head I used to only tell myself how worthless I was or what a failure I was. At the time it was the only sort of self talk I had. I recommend every morning telling your self (out loud) that you are a worthwhile person. Start of small because if you are like me you won't believe it at all and that's normal. After a while you will start to develop an inner voice that is encouraging towards yourself rather than detrimental. Keep at it. When you are at your job, home, or just out and about and run into situations where that negative talk starts up learn to recognize it and try to replace it with encouragement. A lot of times we are sympathetic to others when they mess up or have failures in their own lives but that voice is absent in our own. Work on having that attitude for yourself. \n\nFriends are little more difficult to make the older you get but one thing that worked for me is finding a spot, such as a coffee shop, bar (try to stay away from this one if you have substance abuse issues), or any social place that people hang out at. The best places are spots where there are regular customers that show up on a weekly bases and where you can sit down and do things on your own, such as reading, studying, working, or browsing the internet. Try to be consistent on the days you are available to show and if you put in a little effort to talk to the people you see regularly you will eventually start to make friends with them. Another option is to pick up a hobby and look online for group meet ups and start there. If you have bad social skills you just have to keep at it, I promise you that it will improve. Also most people don't mind people with bad social skills so long as you are a kind person, they will just see you as quirky.\n\nMy last piece of advice is if you are someone who responds strongly to negativity from others try to understand that the people who are cruel to you don't think about you when they wake up, go through there day to day activities, and go to sleep at night. I tell myself why should I think about these people when they don't think about me. I need to live for myself and make decisions for myself without thinking of those people. I dress the way i want to dress because I want to. I do the things i do for myself because I want to. If I am going to focus on myself those people have less and less room in my life and the happier I will be."

        "body": "I'd say love them at a distance for a little bit while you're trying to retrain your brain. Ive had to retrain my brain over many people (my sister and a few ex friends) and its hard work but doable. Being around the people that make life miserable creates hostility, sadness, lowered self-worth, and sadness. You can love them, but keep them at arms length till you heal your brain.\n\nBut unlike you, im a happy person who loves the joys and sorrows of life. There are 3 important things about happiness; it's an active choice you have to make whenever things are bad, you have to embrace and live life to feel it, and happiness is a habit in a sense where you have to fake it till you make it. The more you are around people or things that make you happy, the more you will learn to see the world through rose colored glasses. Happy emotions cause chemical changes in the brain and release different chemicals to the body, that will change your brain and your body with time. So that being said, heres my advice on how to live:\n\nStart surrounding yourself with things you enjoy. Start dopamine decorating. \n\nStart dancing to music with a good glass of wine, and an incense stick as you clean the kitchen. Try to feel the song in your soul, let it run deep through your body. Feeling deep is good.\n\nFamiliarize your brain with a specific smell when you're doing happy activities, be it perfume or incense or a candle. New research is showing that by associating a feeling with a smell, you can reverse trick your brain into feeling happier when you smell that smell, which is great to get you out of funks. \n\nStart going out with friends on Friday's, and make sure you're the one reaching out to make the plans. Being around people who have a happy outlook on life is a good way to study these people, but also forming a habit to seeing loved ones is great for overall mental health. Always plan around an activity or an enjoyable location. And be honest with these people about your mental state. When things are hard, lean on their support. But when things are good, life will create awesome memories for you.\n\nDon't be afraid to make a fool of yourself every once in a while in Public, cause that's how the best memories are made. \n\nBuy a few houseplants and literally put your hands in the dirt. Repot things, because soil has natural chemicals in it that are absorbed through the skin that literally creates happiness and peace in the brain. Likewise feel the rain on your face, on occasion. \n\nMake something. Doesn't matter if your crafty, or good, or not. The brain likes to learn. And also the satisfaction of creating something is great to boost a sense of accomplishment, and in the long run happiness.\n\nExcersize. I mean I'm sure you already know this, but nothing is better for mental health than exercise.\n\nStart dressing cute or embracing your own style. Nothing is a better ego boost than knowing you look good. Once I educated myself on fashion and started getting compliments on my outfits every time I went out, I started feeling much better about myself. Now I look back at old photos and feel sorry for the girl who felt trapped.\n\nGo on vacations to relax, but also see the world and experience all you can! Even if it's just visiting one state over. Make it the best experience you can.\n\nPut down the phone. This one's hard for me and alot of people. But it sucks away your life.\n\nRemember, happiness is a habit, and no one else can create it for yourself. You have to get in there and choose it every day, until soon enough you start feeling it in your own life. And then one day it'll become like a drug to you and you will never look back, and you'll be proud of your growth!"

As long as you are healing and becoming better each day, your life has meaning. \n\nAnd yes, forgiveness. It is so important to your healing. Forgiveness does not mean accepting wrong behavior, it means choosing not to repay pain for the pain you suffered. If your parents are still affecting you, keep your distance. But they probably grew up in similar environments as you did and repeated the behavior they learned. If you can come out of that vicious cycle, you will have accomplished something they did not. It takes only willingness and a great deal of patience towards yourself.\n\nCommunicate with your husband about your difficulties so he knows you need time to heal. If you want more feedback, do share with me about the specific difficulties you have in your friendships and other relationships."

Being in this world together is humanity, people are out for themselves. Did I mention I think differently.\n\nA similiar phrase: Did I mention I'm crazy.\n\nI'm not so I wouldn't dare say that. Think a little differently.\n\nDefinitely more intrinsicately(never used the word before, misspell? Google: intrinsically I lose) Put yourself out there, find humans, evolved minds to bond with, make friends, and enjoy the pleasures of life. Together. Love your husband just cause. You found a mate. Lots of us are lonely. Congratulations. I'm proud of you. I'm happy for you."

        "author": "rrlzsrnc",
        "timestamp": "2024-03-06T15:46:48",
        "body": "Psychologically, we are made up of parts and some of our parts are saboteurs. They are usually well intentioned according to their own beliefs. (They have distinct personalities- where else did you think dissociative identity disorder came from? did you think some people are cut from a completely different cloth? We're all cut from the same cloth, some of us just get bent too much or whatever)\r  \n\r  \nA top truth of psychology is that people go around the world judging and projecting. We can't help it and we need to. We try empathize and sympathize. What are those things? Why do we do that? But anyway we do so imperfectly. Sometimes our best efforts are in vain or even worse than just being in our own place. Sometimes people want us to be in our own ego. As much as people criticize egos and even even even criticize narcissism, sometimes its what people respond to. There is that dual mode - of verbal criticism and behavioral \"praise\" or reward. What are we to make of that? Or a similar thing, verbal criticism of the root and tree structure necessary to produce fruit, while also demanding the fruit. Or the criticism in one mood and praise in another mood. All of these things are not gaslighting per se but they have that effect, of destabalizing the other, creating confusion and mal-adaptation. But anyway before you kill or dismiss your ego and self-centeredness, not everyone wants you to be nice as much as they want and need you to be authentic. It can put a burden on the other when you're too nice to them. So... how do you know? What side do we err on? What's the heuristic? Well I always err on certain sides, the nice guy side and that's fine and all but one should not tolerate any error, as much as possible. Error is still error. \r  \n\\--\r  \nWe all pay a price for what we care about- outside ourselves. Care well. Do we care about others opinions? Sometimes we need to care about ourselves the most. There's a paradox that when we finally become selfish we can finally be nice and honest and respectful to others. To many, dishonesty is the worst form of disrespect. I like strong women for example, who set boundaries. The type of women who tell me they're strong and entitled but are spotty in their communication are often not really strong and of course I have compassion for whatever they're going through but they annoy me by not being clear. They gaslight, on the skirts of relationship. I've never done gaslighting in a relationship but in trying to form them I think we've all been gaslit. I always search myself, self reflect and all, introspect. I introspect to try to learn and let's be honest, ultimately fix what's going on and get power. This is not a pity party. I am only trying to talk psychological truth because I'm sure I'm not alone but there's this idea, which is generally a good one: If you keep failing multiple times with multiple people, the problem is probably not them, it's you. That's a good place to start but the problem also could be cultural, could be systemic. It really could be. Little differences, differentials can have big outsized consequences too, but it's always good to look inside yourself and find ways to change and transform.  \r  \n\r  \nReally finding something, and truly changing is hard. Hard hard. Whether we are biologically hard wired for something or habits and ideas just get hardened, or there is low visibility into one's subconscious, for whatever reason, true transformation, resulting in new normals, can often be hard. I didn't invent this and this is not one size fits all but I like the parts model of psychology. We have multiple parts, that almost have their own identities. I remember hearing Dave Ramsey listen to a caller. The caller was under 18 and was making tons of money. He didn't know if he should tell his mom. I like Dave Ramsey generally. He's an overal good guy. The caller was sincere. He started to tell Dave Ramsey I wanted to x. I wanted to tell her but... And Ramsey interrupts and says \"No, you didn't. If you did you would have x\". Then he laughts, hehe I told him some truth. In so doing, he totally and utterly invalidated the whole field of internal family systems therapy or parts work (and was condescending). I guess we don't have parts, Dave. I guess we are just a mono-mind. But then pray tell why did he have an inner conflict? If he's a mono-mind, why did he have doubt and inner tension? Why was he not just like \"I ain't telling nobody\". Dave Dave Dave. A man of the word, and the word says he who listens before speaking is a fool. He was a fool in that moment \r  \n\\--\r  \n\r  \nI find parts work interesting. I was going to a cafe for my night of reflection and slow thinking and personal time after work, which is relaxing and I treasure. As I was going there I had the idea to read about parts and see if anyone wrote about that. They did but it's also implicit- and explicit, in our language. \r  \n\r  \nI lost a lot of what I wrote and I'm frustrated because I think it was good but I'll live. If what follows seems out of sync it may be but I'll try summarize and try close. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n If someone rejects you, a part of them may have rejected you, based on anything, based on generalized anxiety disorder, but a part of them might be interested in going out and even jumping for joy and kissing you, but you'll never know. When people say \"a part of me wants to x but I think..\", they are revealing a truth about parts but what is the \"I\"? Is it a committee of parts overall, it is a dominant sub-part that has control or is it the spokesman part or is it the self? Some of the writers say there are many parts but one self, one immutable self beneath it all. That is interesting and I find getting into all of this relaxing, deeply relaxing. \r  \n\r  \nI started with talk of sabotage by parts. Sometimes that part is a happy part, but a part that gets happy not for some sublime reason or no reason at all but the fact of existence, but spikes in happiness out of desperation or from despair out of fear, or out of tryin to help make a situation better, mortgaging the future. Sometimes it's better to be based, angry, metallic. Sometimes it is important to recognize the brokenness in the self or the world. It is good to be idealistic and I think wholeness is unequivocally good, but recognizing brokenness is also good because things are rarely their ideal and there is a part that for whatever reason always wants to be happy and keep you mollified. This part can be dangerous too because it mortgages the future, prevents hard truths from being accepted and real change from happening. Men often change only when they absolutely need to. I probably have to talk to this part and see why he is the way he is and what he's trying to do. Usually there is reason to have optimism, but also reason to have pessimism so both parts have valid points. I am a natural optimist and that is not always a good thing. It's been work to appreciate the value of non emotional pessimism - not despondency but letting go of hopes and misplaced implicit or explicit faith. These two parts, the smiling face and the sad face anyway probably always have a thing with each other and in everybody have to figure out how to be in balance, or the self has to guide them and give them voice. There is a place for anger, and selfish anger. In this life, in a way, everything is personal. Everything is personal, everything is personal in a way, and a judgment against us- at some level. We dismiss this but too much dissociation from life, too much observer mode is also a risk, and a trap that I have fallen into. People don't want observers. They want engagers. Dissociation has its deep and subtle causes and disguises. People have been told again and again to not take things personally and of course there is value and truth in that but there is also value and truth in the opposite, and the opposite is the natural response, which now to me is a kind of red flag- have we been killing off and discouraging the natural impulse and to what long term cost? Has it been a mortgage cope, a deferral of pain, a punt? Do people even want us to take nothing personal? Is it useful for some people to not cause drama and be easy to manage but not necessarily in everyone else's interest? And is this entity ever a third party (i.e. school system, etc) and not the two direct parties involved in a transaction? I am always wary of third parties, who say they are being protectors and arbiters. We need independent third parties to be sure, but one also has to be wary of when they insert themselves, and when they program and teach, or 'guide' others. This is deep and subtle and abstract stuff. I'm speaking at the max level of generality here and I understand that but aren't these good questions? \r  \n\r  \nAnyway, to start to wrap up, true and lasting change towards greater effectiveness can be challenging. Psychology is so broad and vast, and connected with logic, with math, with philosophy and daily life. It is always good to feel 'integrated' and if we are indeed made up of parts, perhaps there is some powerful \"integration by parts approach\" we can take to healing, becoming whole and authentic and powerful and free. In terms of acting in the world, it can be hard to find the differential in this life. What is it, the difference that makes the difference, whether for personal mind change or for outer life action, the dx of the equation and how do we move it or manipulate it? \r  \n\r  \nI'll end with this. What is truth? How do we know what is true? There is logical axiomatical or definitional truth- 2+2 = 4. There is objective sensory positivist truth but there are also things that are true but unprovable, that I think are more than just normative but true - like true psychologically. What is the heuristic for that? I'd like to suggest the body as a good basis, what makes you feel connected to the body and at peace, and not second guessing yourself. Everyone can be king in their own home and walk around like they own the place (because they do) but how about when we are out and about? Does our body shut down? Do we collapse or do we expand or be free? There's nothing wrong with being shy, and attentive. Shyness confers many advantages, to the individual and the group.  That's not the same as collapsing. When we feel something is right and in accord, maybe it's true. There's no other way to measure this stuff, these ideas and it feels good to be in flow in the body, uncaring and unsorry, just who you are, free and unencumbered.",

        "body": "I have this constant problem of me wanting to do a lot of things for my future, mostly studying but I can't get myself do it.\n\nI work 8 hours a day + commuting so I have a good 2 hours to be productive if I take away exercise and bed time routine. I do have a bed time routine so that I won't rush to bed after dropping my pen and it helps me wind down and turn off my brain or it helps me get some positivity after a day of work and before an other day of work. \n\nSo it's not like I spare me-time because I can't even function without my morning and evening routine. But I can use those 2 hours to study and I do want to study because I love studying and most importantly I NEED it for my future.\n\nI dislike my workplace more and more and it kinda motivates me to do my best so I can get away, but when I actually am at home to do the thing, I get anxiety.\n\nI constantly feel like I want to just *freestyle* through the afternoons, but even though I have hobbies, after a couple of days I miss doing something productive.\n\nBut when I have to dig myself in studying, I'm scared that time will go by so fast and it'll be evening and the next workday starts. This makes me study shallowly and when I'm like 'okay, let's do research' etc, I get instant anxiety because I know if I get hyperfocused, evening comes before I blink twice.\n\nIt's like my brain knows it's important to work towards my goals but at the same time it sends signals that if I do this really seriously, time passes by in an instant. \n\nUntil today, I didn't even know what this anxiety was, but now I think it's something similar to chronophobia??? I do have a fear of time passing, but on a bigger scale. Like years going by so fast etc.\n\nDid anyone every experienced this? How did you move on? If I feel good, I can enjoy studying so much but now I just feel like escaping my responsibilities because I want to enjoy my days. I was burnt out until recently and simply resting, watching TV-shows or reading did help, but now I actually want to be more productive and then comes the anxiety.\n\nIn 2019 I had a severe burn out because I had a side-job, plus I went to GYM and studied after getting home. When I was doing it, I felt great because I had motivation and I had never experienced this anxiety before. I felt happy studying, I felt accomplished, then obviously came the burnout and after that year, whenever I started something, I got the anxiety so I thought I had burnout PTSD lol\n\nI also kinda have recurring existential OCD since 2019 and it doesn't help that my compulsive thoughts are all about 'what's the meaning of doing this?'",

When someone talks about him, or I saw an old man looks like him, I will become emotional and will brawl my eyes out. My throat hurts too when crying. Sometimes I sit in the car for 1-2 hours just to cry because I miss him so much. \n\nMy mother brought me to the clinics after 2 weeks he passed away, the Dr said I might have depression and anxiety attack, because I often dreamt of him and waking up crying, and sometimes I cannot breathe, it feels like my throat clench and I was gasping for air, but we never had a follow up. \n\nNow as an adult, I have tried to reach the local psychiatrist but they only put me in counselling session, but they never call back to set a session. I just stopped trying because I am tired.\n\nI miss him a lot and I had no one to talk to. Obviously I dont want to talk to my family about this because I dont want to make them cry with me as well. \n\nI need your support 😭",

He would want you to remember him, remember the good times, the times he really told you off for doing that thing you shouldn't have (we've all got one of those). The times you laughed together.\n\nHe'd want you to be happy. \n\nIt sounds like you are stuck in the grieving process. I get it, my parents separated when I was 9, I am 42 and although I see my dad 2-3 times a year I can't watch father-son moments on the TV because it upsets me that I didn't have those moments. My dad is basically a stranger to me, and it does hurt.\n\nHave you researched the steps of grieving? Have you googled for ways to deal with the loss of a parent?  There may be something that helps.\n\nFor me, it's writing. I write it all down, good and bad, and getting it all out helps so much.  because it's written down my brain kind of goes \"I don't need to keep that in there anymore!\" and it can move on\n\nMaybe try writing about him, write down all your memories, and think about how you 2 were together, what you learned from him, and what things from him you'll pass on when you are a parent.\n\nMy grandad passed when I was about 12, 30 years later I still miss him, he was a character.  He used to sing a song \"X is a funnion, got a face like a pickled onion!\", one of many silly random songs, but I now sing them to my kids, and I'm hoping they will pass it on to theirs.\n\nBecause of that, he's not fully gone, part of him remains, even something so silly."

For me, I promised myself in the very beginning to not fight the grief but let it roll in when it did. I didn't want to compound my grief and still be struggling with it years later. It's the best decision I ever did with my grief process. I would say I was in active grief for 1.5 yr and then began to fully process the grief through therapy.  Even if your family seems distant or unapproachable to talk about your Dad, they still may be grieving too and struggling like you. Not everyone is open with their grief and where they're at with it. I don't know where you're located, but if therapy has been a frustrating experience for you there are grief process groups that may be available in your area. That can also be a useful tool if individual therapy isn't for you.  You can meet others that are going through a similar journey that can sometimes make all the difference.  Losing a parent is hard, no matter the relationship you had with them. It can feel like losing a limb, and having to relearn life all over again with that handicap. I hope you're able to begin your grief process and journey and hope you're able to find peace and healing."

Its normal to grieve over a parent even after 10years. Doesnt mean anything js wrong with you. Your a human that lost a parent. In no way does it mean that you have a mental illness. But if you want to heal from that loss. Having a therapist to talk to and being focused on wanting to heal will help you. Healing isnt something that just happens, you have to put the effort into it. For me I dont grieve anymore because I discovered another father I had that was with me through everything I went through and he healed me. That was god. Christianity teaches that god is our father and we are his children and realizing that healed the hole in my heart. What youre feeling just means you havent healed yet. Simply."

Im fine with that.\n\nBefore i was born he and my mother decided not to get me, after that my mother still believed in that, that she can raise me alone woth the mother part of my famaly (aunt, grandma, etc.) well, she was right. So he left and i was raised fatherless. \n\nWhen i did turn 16, my mother told me that he died in 2018 and i sadly would never be able to meet my father, but she bet he would be proud of me. He never got the balls to meet me actually. He lived near the hometown of my aunt, he actually knew some stuff about me, how i look, how old i am etc. I mean, yeah. He was still my father.\n\nBut around 5 years i was born, he met a woman with a child. They where a happy family together. My aunt actually saw him one day with that woman and child. My aunt ran up to hip and kicked him in his kneecaps, but he endured it and did let it happen, cause he know he deserved it. \n\nStill, im fine with it. In fact, i did not even cry when i was told that he is not there. I never even knew who he was or what his name was. No one ever told me. My mother was just one day: \"hey, we need to talk\" i sat down and she startet tearing up. I did not understand. She said \"its time for you to know something\" she shoved me pictures of him and his grave. Thats how i met my father, his name, how old he was, etc etc. I hugged my mom, framed the pictures to honor him.\n\nTill that day i think sometimes \"what would have happend if we would have met?\" I get always told i look like him, have his humor, his wide cross (back) etc etc. \n\nLast year, i was at my aunts place. My aunt and me where shopping a bit, till The best friend of my father passed by. He could not trust his eyes. \"its like i am seing him\" he started tearing up, i mean. Sure. His best friend passed away over 5 years ago, and now his son is standing infront of him. Looking like his best friend. \n\nAgain, that i had no father figure does not matter. I am who i am. Sure, at work i got told once \"its visible that you had no father figure\" but it wasnt meant in a hard way. The co worker did mean it in more of a humorfull way. Thats now two years ago, and i still Remember that sentence so well. But hes right, i am not really *A man*. I am not that strong, i am not really into Cars. I am not into all those *man things*. But who cares? \n\nI started my apprentiece ship and had two instructors. One 57 and the other one 37 years old. Funny, i was 17 at that point. We three harmoned so god damn well. And it was so awesome, i had out of nowhere two \"father like\" figures at once, randomly. These two guys did change a bit about me and myself. I got stronger (maybe also because the job), i got more open, have more *man talks*, wich i dont really like that much, ehhh. Anyways, i still like these two, but i am still *not a real man*, but maybe i dont wanna be.\n\nWell, not having a father or never having one is not that bad? My bond with my mother was/is insane. Its like speaking and looking in a mirror, when my mother and me are together. We think so many times the same, have the same ideas, we even have same dreams at night. As a child, when i had a nightmare, she had one too. Insane, its like we have the same mind.\n\nDont worry, not everyone needs a father figure. For what? Who even cares? What does it change? I never had one either.\n\n#Holy, this text is way to long, i am sorry."

        "body": "Oh no worries, I would say after about a yr, ( I have history of depression too) I had a breakdown. I had been waiting for it all along, but it felt delayed being about a yr later when it happened. That's probably the lowest I've ever been depression wise, I was actively finding ways to unalive myself and it was very scary! Looking back, I needed to be hospitalized, but I barely hung on until I could get into outpatient therapy. I did start meds at that time and were on them for about a yr or so and went off them once I felt more stabilized and had a good amount of time with the stability. \n\nMy best advice for you, especially since it sounds like prolonged grief as well as possibly compounded, I'd set yourself up with a therapist and start the therapeutic grief process. That will be a pillar in your grief journey. If your therapist feels that meds might be helpful to help stabilize your mood, see a psychiatrist and see what they recommend. But the nature of grief, you'll have rogue waves of it without notice and those can take you down for the count. You need a life preserver in those moments, and therapy will be a good one for you. \n\nI don't know the way your father passed, but mine passed after a 2 month battle with cancer. It was quite traumatic for me to see my father, who was a stoic, steadfast and strong man who never showed weakness to become so weak, vulnerable and sick. The Superman cape came off and it was incredibly traumatic. I ended up having situational PTSD for about 2 years afterwards regarding my own health because I was so traumatized seeing what my Dad went through. I had a few panic attacks and rationalizing my anxiety was difficult. But I no longer struggle with it. Therapy will help you work through that. \n\nThe longer you don't get help for grief, the more it will debilitate you. There's no \"one size fits all\" timeline for grief, but 10 yrs after the fact and still experiencing overwhelming grief isn't ok or healthy. Grief can become dangerous if the process isn't moving, if it stays still you run the risk of depression and other things making things worse."

I'm trying desperately to hold it together.\n\nSomeone called me out though, and brought attention to the fact that I hadn't dealt with his death yet. I don't actually know how to. I have some really good pictures of him that I keep by my desk and I've had some friends suggest stuff like, writing a letter to him that he'll never read. I loved him so much, I was thinking I might literally dedicate a day to him. It would be a day of just spreading positivity and happiness in some way. That's what he would have wanted. To help people and bring happiness. What other types of things can I do to honor him?",

Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health, a book based on polls of more than 3,000 professionals, says that The Feeling Good Handbook by Dr. David Burns, a psychiatrist and cognitive therapy expert, is the one recommended most often by professionals.\n\nIn recent years, there has been very encouraging evidence for therapeutic breathing, which can be combined with cognitive therapy methods for dealing with worrisome thoughts.\n\nWhen we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.\n\nOne is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min in the early morning and at bedtime is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.\n\nWhen you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.\n\nDon't make mountains out of molehills.\n\nAlso, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.\n\nThe treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.\n\nDon't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.\n\nA good habit - always respond to a stressful moment by breathing slowly. Just a few slow breaths is good."

Because of all the trauma I’ve experienced and the comorbid mental illnesses, I switch between “classical” BP II, ultra-rapid cycling, and mixed episodes, both at random or when triggered. I tried Depakote, and it worked so well for me. I was happy and didn’t have any cycling or mixed episodes, even when life was objectively depressing (tbh, it might have been numbing me, which I interpreted as happy). \n\nThe thing is, I experienced so many side effects that I’m getting off of it. Alopecia (I’ve lost I’ve 50% of my hair), gained 25% of my body weight, constant bloating, needing to pee all the time, increased and putrid flatulence, loose and putrid stools, brain fog, sedation to the point I could sleep 24 straight hours, and that’s not all. Like I’ve had nearly every side effect it could cause and pretty severe intensity of them. So, I’m getting off of it and starting the process of getting on Lamictal. I’m just so upset because it really did work, but of course, things had to go wrong. \n\nEven before the Depakote, I tried Latuda, and it did nothing but give me nasty side effects until we figured out I needed to split my dose, taking half in the morning and half at night. The side effects went away, but I still got nothing from it for my symptoms. This sucked because Latuda is really well-tolerated, from what my psychiatrist says. So here I am, going onto mood stabilizer #3 with 8 months down the drain. I’m so anxious because it takes so much time just to titrate up and settle into meds without any guarantee it’s going to work or that it won’t give me issues. And I just have to go through life while this is happening. I really believe that I am just cursed and that something always has to go wrong. Does anyone else have experiences like this? I’d appreciate knowing I’m not alone here😭",

I know she probably just got off or maybe sat down or something but I started stressing that maybe I imagined her and it was a schizophrenic hallucination. I know it sounds really dumb and I’m probably just creating problems for no reason, but I really needed to get it off my chest. I’m so scared of it idk what to do anymore,same thing when I have some intrusive thoughts sometimes-i instantly think i’m a bad person and it might be schizophrenia that causes disturbing thoughts or something.\nAll I’m asking is did someone go through something like this? How can I stop stressing about it so much? The stress is killing me. Thank you for listening❤️",

        "body": "Hi! First of all, disclaimer, not a mental health proffesional, just someone who knows a lot of stuff from her own experience and my job :) \n\nSo, yes, actually, I used to be scared I was developing schizophrenia. I thought I was seeing stuff in my peripheral and had a bunch of gross, violent intrusive thoughts. I did not end up having schizophrenia, and you probably don't either. Schizophrenia is fairly rare, affecting only 0.32% of people world wide (according to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schizophrenia)), and tends to run in families. For me, I just ended up having really extreme anxiety (and was jumping at normal, every day objects I saw in my peripheral), with some mild symptoms of OCD (intrusive thoughts making me feel like an awful person). Addressing the anxiety really helped with the symptoms you're listing. \n\nFrom your description, I would suggest looking into therapy or coping mechanisms for anxiety, especially if stressing about having schizophrenia is impeding on your every day life. Here's a list of mindfulness techniques that I find really helpful when I'm in the midst of hightened anxiety: \n\n[https://www.lifebulb.com/blogs/five-easy-mindfulness-techniques-to-calm-anxiety](https://www.lifebulb.com/blogs/five-easy-mindfulness-techniques-to-calm-anxiety)\n\nAlso, having full-blown visual hallucinations like you wrote about is usually (although not always) linked to more severe cases of schizophrenia ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2660156/)), in which case you would likely be experiencing other schizophrenic symptoms.  \n\nI hope this helps calm your anxiety a little bit! I think it's normal, especially for people prone to high levels of anxiety, to feel like this. While I'm not saying it's impossible for you to have schizophrenia, I don't think it's something you need to worry about right now. Instead, focus on decreasing your stress levels, notice triggers to your anxiety, and make note of how stress and stress-reducing activites affect the hallucinations and fear. If the paranoia and hallucinations persist or get worse, I would go see a mental health proffesional :)"

When I was young and dumb, I had a drink before a work interview (clean now!), resulting in me arriving 15 min late to the interview. I just knew I couldn’t perform like I wanted to, if I was the red-faced, sweaty palms, and the big one: my mind running 3,000,000 mph—that’s what I thought the booze would help. I was 22 and desperately dumb bleh!\n\nOh, and in other situation, I’ve had a stone-in-chest type panic attack that lasted four hours. For those unfamiliar, it feels like a fist is squeezing your heart for several hours, up until bed.\n\nAnd don’t mention the decades of sweaty palms; so sweaty when I’m anxious that I’m constantly washing with warm water and drying until they are boooone ddrrryyyyy… but that never lasts, especially when the anxiety of meeting “important” people builds and starts the cycle anew.\n\nSo now, with my new MD, we are considering take-as-needed-medicine: Xanax, Klonopin, etc. He seemed open to any of those aforementioned, but I was a tad reluctant due to how addictive it is.\n\nI want to make my most important note here, to all of this, is just that beta blockers don’t do much at all. My new MD prescribed those and I haven’t felt anything, sometimes even after doubling the dose (OKd by MD).\n\nI understand that beta blockers and meds like Xanax and Klonopin are two different meds.\n\nOne last thing… I believe something like Xanax would work far better than Ambien for falling asleep. I tried Ambien twice with this MD and both times I could not sleep, after taking the pill directly before bed. \n\nMy dad just retired after owning a private medical practice for over 40 years. Like me, he can occasionally have issues falling asleep well, or going back to bed and falling asleep after something startling. The only sleep pill this man keeps at all times? A quarter bar of Xanax.\n\nI guess my question is, could Xanax be a good sleep med? If not, then does everything I mentioned before the sleep section sound like I could get a therapeutic response from meds such as Xanax and Klonopin? I would as a matter of course talk to my MD about alllllll this!\n\nThis is my first time asking anyone this who aren’t family (whose main concern is the addictive part). I trust you smarties on *certain* subs! Thanks! ♥️ ",

I enjoy work alone more than teamwork but I’ve had some enjoyable moments working with teams and I’m looking forward to having more opportunities to work on that skill."

It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.\n\n Simple distractions can help - anything that changes your mood like beautiful music."

I am actually here to help people, write with strangers and it actually kinda helps myself to calm myself down. I actually see reddit as a comfort zone now for last months. Ive been very active, not only in the mental health sub. But back to you.\n\nI guess its a normal feeling in youre current sitiation and the place you are. You dont have to feel alone there, there are MANY Others that feel like that. I could tell you to focus on stuff you like to get a better feeling on stuff you do, to kinda get a bit of motivation back. Like drawing or making music, anything you like. Or maybe there was a hobby you had as a kid, but sadly gave up on it. Or maybe try something new? Like writing a novel or baking? \n\nI can recommend, cause i would guess you think a lot, do a little walk and listen to some music. I usually go alot on nightwalks that can go like over 5hours by just walking through the empty streets from the city i live in. Its calming down and helps me get my head empty. Sure my problems dont go away, but its defently a difference by thinking while walking than thinking in school/work. I got myself into reading again, now i read some novels while im at a park at night.\n\nDont look back on bad stuff that happend, like things you might feel miserable or your childhood or sm. Focus more on stuff you actually enjoy, try to make conversations. I know its hard. I cant even do that. And thats why i am here, to get my social status filled. I write more on reddit than i talk with people irl.\n\nI know, there are people, like me, out there that would be there for you, even when its just writing in a privat chat on reddit. Its even better when the other person is a stranger. My ears are all up for you."

We lose nothing when we communicate with ourselves, listen and converse to ourselves, so why not do that? \n\nI committed suicide a few times, still have suicidal thoughts here and there. I’m still struggling with it, but what really eases me sometimes is that I really understand the person I am who is vulnerable and suffering so much, who is sometimes desperately in need of care and love. And I’m always ready to listen to what this little soul of mine wants to say to understand and empathize with her, and take actions about it. I don’t feel lonely when I’m aware of that. \n\nIt may sound abstract but I do think we all need to form a good relationship with ourselves first before anyone else. It’s where we start to understand what “love yourself” truly means. Take small steps and appreciate what we’ve done well no matter how small it is, like have our room tidied up, give ourselves good meals, do something we actually like, etc. Basically spend time on ourselves, put efforts in ourselves and take the credits for taking care of ourselves. They are internal matters that we can work with. External ones like godly expectations and comparisons can wait. You do you first."

She managed to get rid of social anxiety and shyness but I still can't how much I try. I'm going an english course and my grades are above the class average. But I get lower than class average in presentations. We also have a speaking exam with a teacher alone in a class. And I get full grades everytime. Even my teacher suggests me \"You should speak in class more, you're wasting your potential. You could be in better positions in your future.\" I try as much as I can and can't stop thinking \"what if my voice cracks or something happens\" But the worst of all when we're doing something one by one. For example when we're waiting for our turn in presentations, my heart rate increasing a lot and I can't stop it. Should I see a psychiatrist? I say a psychiatrist not a psychologist because I don't believe just some good words can heal me. I think only medicines can cure me. I feel sad about wasting my potential.

        "timestamp": "2024-03-06T10:22:33",
        "body": " \n\nHi, my name is Autumn. I'm 20 years old, female, I was diagnosed with ADHD in grade school, and I don’t know what to do with my life.   \n\n\nI finished school but only with the help of my parents. I'm not smart, not smart enough for college, I have some common sense I guess, but smarts not so much. I have an amazing mom, she’s so kind and caring. I couldn’t be luckier to have her and my stepdad, he isn’t the best, he smokes weed (yes it’s legal and he has a card) but he also drinks, he’s drank since he was 14 years old, my nana and papa (his parents) let him and they regret it. He didn’t work for 7 years while my mom busted her ass off for us and I hate him sometimes because of it. He has a job now though and it’s thanks to him I passed any of my classes, so I guess I should be more grateful. He’s a smart man, he does coding and it’s thanks to him I play games. But, it’s also thanks to him that my mom is in the shape she is. My mom pushes herself past her limit, she was overweight when they met and got married (I was 12 at the time) and she’s gotten surgery since then and has lost lots of weight, but because of all the work she had to do it grinded on her bones and her knees are horribly weak now. Dad has recently gotten a job however, because mom can no longer work. I wish he realized sooner what drinking all day and playing games and sleeping does to someone, but I haven’t fallen far from the apple tree have I? (Is that the right saying?)   \nWe had a lot of pets, dogs, and mom would always call during or right after work while coming home if he can clean up the house and start on dinner, he would shout at me instead to do it and I did, it wasn’t abusive the way he did it, he just has a loud voice. But I would clean. I cleaned every day, sometimes made pizza so mom would have something to eat right before going to bed, and dad would always drink, play games, or nap while she worked… They would fight too, quite a lot, mom always said it was just arguing but either way it was shouting. One night my mom even threatened to leave him, she told me to pack a bag and that they were taking the car and going. He was so drunk he could hardly talk, but it seemed to sober him up a little because they started shouting in the front yard… I just cried and ran up to an old house that no one lives in and sat on the back porch, I cried for a good hour or so, so scared that they would just divorce…I hated him, but I still loved him at the same time.  \nEither way, despite all of that, I love them both so much, we’ve had amazing good times together and our bad ones, he’s still a decent dad and mom has always been the best and most supportive. I mean hell, we’re Christian yet when I came out, she just hugged me and said she would always love me no matter what, she used to tell me how she would never agree with gays and now she supports me. She’s the best mom anyone could ask for, but I feel like I’m nothing but a disappointment to her and the family.  \nMy dad’s side of the family is far more, big, rich, uptight people. Of course, not enough to stop dad from drinking his life away to the point that he could die, but just enough that every time you step into the room it’s always nagging about jobs or the future. My dad’s mother had the audacity to tell my mom that, “maybe you should try to get another job.” My mom has done nothing but work before I was even born, taking care of her mom, taking care of her brother, and then I was born. She’s physically worked herself to the point that every time she walks it sends sharp pain through her spine. Her doctor literally said she had the knees (the bones) of an 80 year old woman… My mom is only 50 years old, and only just turned 50 a few months ago.\n\nWe aren’t rich, but we’re not poor either, we’re grateful enough to live in a decent little trailer, we have our own land so we don’t live in a trailer park. We live in the countryside, it’s nice here. I've been raised here my whole life, we don’t own anything though, but it’s still home and it’s always been my home. \n\nNow, I guess for why I’m making this, I don’t know what to do with my life. I don't see a point in doing anything with my life because what's the point when were all going to die in the end  \nI know they say “live in the present” but I have a hard time doing that, ironically it’s because I’m always scared of who I’m going to lose next… I have a fear of death, not for myself but for everyone else. I don’t have many friends, only friends I have are my cousin and adopted brother, my family is my everything… And I’m terrified of losing any of them… I lost my Papaw a few years ago and it was hard enough. I'm scared of what will happen to my mom when Mamaw dies… It’s coming and each day when I go to check on her I’m so scared that she’ll just be laying there on the couch, not asleep or awake… And I’m even more scared of losing anyone else… My mom, cousin, brother, dad, anyone…They are all I have.\n\nI want to die before any of them die. I know it’s horribly selfish, but I can’t see myself doing anything in the future, I have no motivation for anything, when I do it’s always very little and it ends quickly. I’m lazy, I’ve never worked a day in my life, I hardly even help my brother clean… I never do anything… All I do is just sit… read.. sleep… play games… Repeat… Sometimes the days just clash together and I forget what I even did the day before… \n\nI have medicine for depression, it’s the best one so far, but I still just want to die, especially before anyone else… Just thinking about my mom or anyone else dying makes me cry and hurt as if they're already gone. I'm scared of what will happen when that day does come… I can’t stand it. I can’t just look back on the good days or imagine what it used to be like I just can’t physically or mentally do that. \n\nI can’t do anything. I mentally can’t process things all at once or I forget quickly and I get overwhelmed, I’ve always been like this and I hate it, I hate myself. I wish I could do better for them, for all of them, they deserve so much, especially my mom. And the most horrible feeling is losing them and I haven't even lost them yet, it kills me and I want to die before they do\n\nI don't know what to do at all",

But, even if they don't believe in therapy and they're proving stubborn or unwilling to be open minded to your explanation, supporting your mental health can be separate from supporting therapy.

You can shift the perspective to, is he willing to support YOU during this time, regardless of the process you may be going through to get better."

It’s the next step-up from being a graduate for 1 year; which I did well in. The onboarding was poor due to extenuating circumstances, I have been thrown into the deep end with various projects being urgent. For example I had to turn a 13 week project around in 6! I had just joined that same week. The nature of the role is always busy, as expected but it’s really starting to impact my mh. \n\nColleagues have given me good feedback and I even won an award..but I still feel really low and have this fear anytime now I will mess up.\n\nI suffer from anxiety in general which I was doing well at managing in my daily/personal life, however because of how chaotic this job continues to be my anxiety have exasperated:\n\nI’m always feeling anxious, I really struggle to detach myself from work in the evenings; almost feel paralysed.\nI’ve cried at my desk several times out of frustration.\nI have lost my appetite sometimes only eating 1 meal a day. \nI either struggle to stay asleep (woken up with a tight chest at midnight) or oversleep cause I’m too afraid of what the day holds.\n• there was one bad night I worried so much I only got 45mins of sleep.\nI’ve called a mental health call centre 6x in the last 2 weeks.\nI have been sick with the flu/bad cough 5x since joining.\nI overthink everything task which I feels delays me. \nI beat myself up over small mistakes.\n\nI don’t know what I can do to help myself out of this. I have spoke to my manager on how I feel. They’re supportive and have provided an action plan. How do I overcome the anxiety & fear that’s been triggered? How can I grow my confidence?\n\nHas anyone ever been in this situation before?\nAny advice would be appreciated 🥺",

Whilst actually not being able to ejaculate even if you masturbate, that's an issue, a fixable one of course so don't let yourself get down. Just know you aren't alone, remember that the one thing nobody ever talks about, especially with guys is sex, masturbation. Problems with sex, masturbation etc are very common, nobody opens their mouth about it, that's the problem, if guys did you wouldn't feel anywhere near as alone trust me. \n\nSex problems are normal, they really are. You've done the right thing talking about it, braver than most let me tell you, and getting scans etc is also so great, its great you are doing something about your problem. And its great you allow your confidence to blossom despite the struggles you've delt with and continue to deal with. \n\nFor me, I'm 17 now and even though many around me are having sex and I do experience problems like trying to be perfect in everything else to make up for the sex part with relationships, I know that I can deal with it, in my own time, in my own space. It may be worrying because you feel people might not want you over it, but just know people do love you for you, its a fixable and workable problem. You aren't alone, take time with it, don't pressure yourself, don't rush or force yourself to do things you don't want to do. Talking about it like you've done and getting scans is great, really great. Most guys are to weak to do that. \n\nFrom what I've read, this is a problem in your mind, you are struggling mentally, but the best part about struggling mentally is that with help you can get yourself out of it. You can address your own issues, maybe get some therapy if you can, talking is the best thing to do, even if it doesn't feel like it would be. \n\nYou're a strong person, brave for sharing this, you will get through it!!!"

I used to feel it wasn’t helping (apart from EMDR which was like a magic wand for nightmares) but over the years I can see my improvement.\n\nI was sexually abused as a child, however my friends’ trauma is a bit different. She never (to my knowledge) experienced anything physical, however her father was verbally abusive towards her and her mother and she also witnessed him hanging himself. He survived, but has not been in her life for over a year. He made contact once to threaten suicide. The family have not heard from him since.\n\nShe doesn’t sleep well, she speaks vaguely of nightmares and paranoia that he is coming to kill her (though these threats never occurred in real life [again, to my knowledge] and the letters she has received appear to be self loathing and desperate rather than threatening).\n\nTo be honest, I love her. I want nothing more than to help her. But my recovery may be different than hers.\n\nAfter much (a decade of) cushioning and comforting and enabling, I learned (in short) that what happened has happened, I cannot change it, but I CAN change the future. My experience doesn’t define me and although that happened to me was at the hands of another, ultimately now I control how my life pans out from here. It’s not my fault, but it is now my responsibility. This has tremendously impacted my way of living. I no longer expect the world to tend to my complaints, I acknowledge them and deal with them.\n\nMy friend does not. She will not go to therapy, she does not acknowledge or validate her experiences, she only complains. I may be selfish in feeling this way but I can’t comfort her forever. I love her, and I want for her to be able to truly cope. I’m not 100% stable, I cannot guarantee that I will be there for her 24/7, which is why she needs to be able to support herself.\n\nI see the path I have been down and I see how it could potentially benefit her, but as I did a few years ago, she doesn’t want to. She doesn’t want to take hold of her life, she doesn’t want to get better. I offer comfort, but with that I offer constructive advice based on my experiences. But she won’t take it.\n\nHow else can I go about supporting her while still encouraging her to seek professional help? ",

I found Kristin Neff's book \"Self Compassion: Stop beating yourself up and leave insecurity behind\"\n\nI'm the sort of person who berates myself for not being where I want to be in life, missing opportunities, not doing the dishes, not calling my parents enough, that sort of thing. Early in the book Dr. Neff describes cheating on her first husband, sort of tries to justify it, and then talks about how she forgave herself. I get that we deserve self compassion when we do something really wrong and this might have been a good story to add later in the book, but it threw up a roadblock for me. I've been cheated on, I have a family member who has dated married men and frankly I've yet to meet someone who's cheated on a significant other and not forgiven themselves. One of the obstacles to self compassion is the belief that if you're not hard on yourself, you'll end up doing bad things. By putting this personal issue at the beginning of the book Dr. Neff reinforced that belief for me and I just wasn't able to get through the rest of the book.\n\nAre there any other self compassion book or other resources by authors other than Dr. Neff?",

I have an older sister that goes to Oxford, a younger sister applying to Oxford next year who will almost definitely get in, a close friend that I have most of my classes with who got into Oxford this year and brings it up pretty often, talking about their open day or their friends outside our school who also got in, about how they'll invite me to their formals since I didn't get in, making jokes about their interview, talking about what they'll do when they go to Oxford, or something related to Oxford. My frustration and sadness isn't at all coming from a place of conscious resentment that she got in, or that my sisters go to Oxford/ will probably go soon. It's just that every reminder sets me off, but I don't want to drag them all down and make them feel responsible for me being insane about this. I literally can't shake it off and I think about it constantly. Every time uni is brought up, especially if it's something Oxbridge-related, I instantly shut down. When my little sister probably gets in next year, I don't even know how I'm going to cope, but I can't just say that to her or to anyone else because it's about her and her application and her achievements, not about me just being a drag on everyone around me. I feel like an utter failure, especially since my school and teachers made a big fuss about getting to interview since we rarely have anyone applying to Oxbridge, nevermind getting in. ",

And a lot of the time, you need to spend more time figuring out why you feel what you feel than you might think.\n\nA good way to get into the habit of it is often to do a diary in the evening where you reflect on your emotions. Another good tip is to remind yourself of three good things that happened each day - this teaches positive thinking which is one of the easiest ways to become happier and to empower yourself so you are better suited to handle the tough things in your life.\n\nObviously this alone doesn't guarantee happiness, but it usually does make a difference."

These links has a lot of tips, and implementing them all at once is impossible. So try to find ways to gradually implement at couple of them in your life and then develop further from there.\n\nOne of the best tips I know is that if a task is too big or you don't get it done, then break it up into smaller tasks until you have a task small enough that you actually do get it done. This is good for everything from getting into the habit of eating healthier to socializing. It is always better to do a little consistently than a lot inconsistently (or not at all). Furthermore, if you get into a habit of doing a little each day, then you can begin building upon it and doing a little more, and that will begin to accummulate quickly."

And that's it, that's the only thing he cares about, that's the only conversation he has with me. Makes me feel alone and used. My mom, which I adore, is the only person that shows warmth and love to me, but I feel like I can't have a deep talk to her because she won't know what to say (it happened a few times so...)\n\nI had a group of friends, but we went separate ways after one of them threw a fit over a venting post I made on Instagram directed towards literally no one, which she took personally, leaving me no space to explain to her what I meant and why I said it. She has a tendency to do this to some of her friends: she starts a fight with someone over something stupid, makes them look like the villain of the story to everyone else, abandons them for a certain period of time and then tries to come back to their life with no apologies, no explanation nor deep talking whatsoever, it happened a few times with different people in the same manner.\n\nI made a few new friends but I get the feeling they will betray me or leave me alone in times of need, as they're not so deep friendships. I can only trust one of them. The rest, I don't feel a connection, I feel more like a toy, someone to hang out with when there's nobody else.\n\nI have a boyfriend, but he also tends to emotionally abandon me in times of hardship, is emotionally abusive and has no respect for me nor the relationship. He doesn't seem to be in love with me either nor feel happy to be with me, judging from the hurtful stuff says to me, how he defends the pedophile that groomed me online when I was 12, how he blames me and only me every time I have a problem with anyone, and how he uses his Instagram account only to follow soft porno girls that look nothing like me or his exes. It's not two or three, it's the majority of people he follows. I hate him at this point and I don't know how to confront him on anything because he escapes these conversations, kicks me out of his house, leaves me on read or ends the phone calls.\n\nI'm looking desperately for a job as a dishwasher or store clerk to pay for a hairdresser course in a local academy and have a future and a specific profession, and I keep getting ghosted by every restaurant and store I applied for as if I am a pest, despite having the experience and motivation they need so much.\n\nI literally have no one to tell me \"oh god you're in very big trouble, let me help you find a job and get you outta this mess\" like I've seen everyone else has. It's all chatting but in the end I've been always alone on every single serious thing that happened in my life. Why do I have to do everything alone? Why?",

        "body": "I hope someone can help me out. This is kind of my last resort now. A little backstory, I am from a very conventionally academic house. My mother and father both are working and are immensely intellectual people, both my mother and father have achieved things only people can dream off (You can even search them on google and YouTube and no they are not Instagram celebrities they have very respectable professions. So you get the gist). Anyway I don't fit in with people. I have friends just not friends friends, but it was never a big deal to me. I always had my family and they always had me.   \nSo I am an engineer and I graduated with a very weird last year. I wanted to try something different and I did but I failed at it. This was the first time I ever failed and it hurt a lot. College finished and I landed a small job nothing too special, but I found people who I can be with who I could finally fit in with. I always knew that it would never last forever but it felt nice. I was open with them I never needed to lie. They even convinced me to go to the gym which I did. I got into great shape I was 5'11 70 kgs pure muscle, abs and stamina. I never smoked, did weed or drank like a pig. I was happy. I even met the most beautiful girl and she said yes, we went out finally and it was perfect. I thought that was it. I wanted to marry this woman right there and then (My god were her eyes just perfect and she still likes me too I think or hope).   \nAnyway fast forward a couple of months, and I get a message from my boss, we have a meeting and I'm laid off, without a warning without any reason. I don't know what I did wrong, I was just asked to pack up and leave. I don't cry usually because apparently men don't cry. So I smile and say thank you Can I call my dad and leave the meeting room. I speak to him for maybe a minute and he knows that something is wrong. I cry and break down. He calms me down and tells me its normal. Everything will be fine. But somewhere deep down something hurts really bad. I gather some courage pack up and leave the office. I don't want to go back there again. I still have all my friends from office, most of them quit right after me too. Anyway a few weeks pass by and the girl starts to get cold feet, she doesn't want to see other people she just is afraid because of her past relationships. So I tell her to take a break and relax I promise that I will always be there.   \nNow I celebrated my birthday alone in my room with just a beer and a cup cake. No friends No food No party. I don't mind it. Its always been like that. Currently I have been rejected by maybe 56-57 companies. I am sleeping with people I don't want to. I am smoking. I am drinking. I am unhappy. I lost my smile. I am disappointing myself and my family on a daily basis. I am everything that I didn't want to be. I like my girl. I love my parents. I wanted to grow up and be world famous one day. I wanted to help people. To save people. I had dreams of becoming a footballer or a boxer. To help my country become the best in the world. To help my people have the best life. I wanted to be with celebrities and the rich. I wanted to be my peoples champion.  \n\n\nI've been told that it's never too late. Never give up. Do more than you can. I wish I had some strength in me left. As I'm writing this I feel like crumbling. My parents say that I've lost my smile, I look stressed. I wish I knew what the correct path was. Today is the 2nd week I got up at 10am instead of 6am. I quit smoking up and I'm 6 months sober. I reduced smoking. I didn't ever know it would be this hard. But I don't want to give up. I wish someone just helped me through this period by showing me a sign or a way. I'll do it without any hesitation. One day I might read this and laugh. I hope it's funny so I can look back and say damn it was hard. I hope I have my girl and my friends around me when I read this out loud later in life. In my own big house. DO NOT GIVE UP EVER. NOT NOW NOT EVER.",

No Matter what group i am in, no matter how loud I talk, I always fade into the background. Even when I tap people on the shoulder. Ignored, talked over, shut down. All my life. Always. I am a very loyal person, and a bit of a people pleaser, though you wouldn’t guess it. I’m very tall, I stand up straight. I look confident. But anyone who makes friends with me eventually takes my loyalty and agreeableness for granted. They think they can ignore me and I’ll never leave them. They think I can be the second choice and I’ll never object. \n\nEven in a friendship of only me and one person, it’s good for a while, and then one day, I’m listening to them ramble about their most beloved things, I laugh, engage, talk, ask questions, and then when they’re done, I start talking about mine, and two seconds in, it’s “oh, that reminds me!” And that Neurodivervent sparkle of mine is squashed and I go back to listening to them talk, albeit a little less enthusiastically. Whenever this happens in a friendship, it just plays in my head. “Here we go again.”\n\nMaybe it’s partially my fault. I’ve always wanted a perfect friend, one that will treat me just how I treat them all the time, which whom i share interests and passions and ideals.

Then he grew too comfortable and it happened all over again and here I am, slowly cutting him off, stomach in my feet, promising myself I’ll never make another friend because I always get taken for granted, and knowing deep down I’ll make the same mistake over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again until the jumbled letters begin to lose meaning like why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why am I like this",

Feeling like this is common, really common. The fact you are worrying about being a failure, means you aren't a failure because you care!!! \n\nConsidering your ibs and emetophobia, no wonder you are mentally exhausted. Is there any type of talking therapy or hypnotherapy you can take or get? In order to stop pacing about, I would find something, something to take your mind off of your fears and feelings, I'm not sure what, for me exercise and going outside for walks helps, plus talking to lots of different people calmy about my worries and fears, relaxing me and taking the pressure of off my family members who I also freakout and pressure, so don't worry you're not wrong for relying on your partner, we all have to rely on somebody or even multiple people when we struggle, but maybe find someone or multiple other people to walk with, talk to and share your struggles. I assure you you'll feel better if you do! \n\nYou can get better though, even with your fears and ibs. It's always possible!!!"

I know nothing about treating phobias, so I don't know if this is helpful or harmful, but a nurse friend of mine says isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol), when inhaled (smelled) will immediately stop the urge to vomit. Google confirms this. There are 70% isopropyl alcohol prep-pads you can get at any pharmacy or grocery store. They're pre-sealed like a fast food wet-nap and small enough for a pocket or wallet. Larger containers of isopropyl alcohol can be kept in a purse or car and since isopropyl alcohol is not drinkable it does not violate open container laws. Maybe keeping some isopropyl alcohol handy would help with the phobia since it would instantly stop you or anyone near you from vomiting?\n\nSome anti-depressants make you feel a lot worse before they make you feel better. I started Paxil a few years ago and week 3 was incredibly rough, but it did start helping in week 4.\n\nFor anxiety I found guided meditation on youtube very helpful. A guided \"body Scan\" meditation forces your focus from whatever thoughts your having to perceiving the physical sensations of your body. I often pick a 10-minute version and if I don't feel better after 10 minutes I'll repeat it.\n\nThere are breathing techniques that help. Google \"Box Breathing\" for a method based on counting and google \"This Calming GIF Can Help You Handle Stress\" for a gif you can focus on while breathing.\n\nThe Universe had to \"nerf\" you, otherwise you'd be too powerful. That's why you can't be normal."

But doing it can really take your mind off your problems because you become more focused on the nerves of making friends.

Googling your problems I've found for me yeah isn't overly helpful to be honest, sometimes it can be like I did learn a little bit about my acne flare ups, but overall too many opinions and false information can just confuse us further. \n\nWhilst you are on the waiting list, do what you can to keep yourself distracted, busy and comfortable with you. Fresh air from walking is amazing, it's really great you're doing that, I am too. \n\nYou seem like you are trying to get better and keep yourself from worsening, I really believe for people like us, doing as much as possible distraction wise can be super helpful :D"

        "body": "I really can’t be bothered to list my whole situation here, but basically, I don’t know why but shit is bad. Like really, really, really bad. And this may sound stupid but please try to understand.\n\nI love movies. I loveeee fictional worlds, sci-fi and fantasy especially. I’ve always wanted to live in another world to the point I would cry. To the point it hurt. I’d always felt like I really knew my favourite characters, I cared about them like they were people, I missed them and longed to meet them. It’s so stupid, isn’t it? \n\nA quick brush over, I cut and I’ve attempted and stuff—sometimes when characters are in situations that remind me of that, I immediately imagine that it is that for some reason. And I can’t shake it. Maybe I want to relate to them more. \n\nI am really hooked on this one show called Bodies right now. My favourite character was Charles Whiteman. If you’ve watched the show you know what ends up happening to him. He gets hung. Emphasis on HUNG. I have tried that multiple times, so my silly little brain was like “he hung himself 🥰 “ and so now I’m lying to myself, saying that is what happened. Feels good weirdly. \n\nBut what is odd about this Charles Whiteman is this:\n\nI always feel Greif for character deaths if I feel as though they are my friends. \n\nBut for him, I felt genuine mourning. It was weird and I felt so stupid for it. I curled up in bed and cried a lot and wished he’d come back.  It felt like id lost someone real, like a close friend or something. And god, believe me, I know how stupid it sounds. So stupid. I don’t mind if you go to the comments and tell me exactly how  dramatic and stupid I’m being. But it really felt real and I’m still fucking sad about it. Really sad.",

I haven't lost my way, I never left the beginning!!! I had no choice but to stay behind everyone else with the shit that was going on before I was even born!

I’m really sick of just feeling so sensitive and overthinking if I’m hated and it’s come to the point where I really think I am hated, and that I have no worth to my friends.\n\nI feel like I seek so much validation from my relationships that my whole identity and happiness is based off of if I’m liked or not. I don’t even know who I am anymore because my happiness is based off of how well my friends treat me and I’m so sick of it I can’t handle it anymore. Am I really just sensitive? I know I am at least a good amount of sensitive, but I’ve always felt like it’s been something a bit more, and that I don’t feel like anyone will ever understand what goes on in my head.\n\nI’m so confused, is this an underlying condition or just a problem with my personality or like trauma? Because my mom acts in the same way towards her boyfriends and friends as well, maybe it’s a learnt trait? Because I also think I got my ED from her as well, but that’s that. \n\nDoes this post make sense? I tried to be detailed but it seems more like word-vomit.. ",

This feeling when thoughts resemble a formless mess, the same meaningless phrases or words are spinning in my head 24/7, they just drive me crazy. In addition to the fog in my head, I am surrounded by a shitty society. I constantly think about gouging out the eyes of one of these scum. All I have are negative thoughts. I'm bad at communicating with people. It torments me that I’m not even a good person, I don’t respect my own morals, sometimes I even humiliate people for my own benefit. I’m also tired of the fact that all people are cruel and merciless, and I’m not much different from them. I hope my death makes more cents than my life. I just want some advice...",

        "body": "Sorry for saying it all so blurry. Regarding these thoughts 24/7, they are in my head when I am not concentrating on thoughts, and I am in this state most of the time. These thoughts have no meaning or relevance to any current situation. For example, these could be some obscene words, and apart from them there is nothing in my head at that moment. The same phrases visit my head no matter what is happening to me at this moment, everything is so terrible that I am seriously thinking of leaving this life, I am not afraid of death, but the only reason I did not kill myself is that what pain this will bring to my family. It all started only after my classmates made my life hell in high school, and this happened for several years. Regarding humiliating people, it does not bring me pleasure, and given my fate, doing this is hypocritical and vile. But when, for example, at school I became an outcast, I sometimes humiliated people who were kind to me in order to rise in the eyes of others. This happened several times, although mostly when no one saw me I communicated well with them as a friend. Now I’m trying to contact them on social networks, but I haven’t succeeded. I am a vile and selfish person, probably only the grave will correct me. I'm trying to be a good person, but I don't know how to fix myself..."

When I left school and all hell was over, I thought that I needed to wait a little, and I would again be a normal person like before. But years pass, and nothing changes, during all this time I was not even happy for a minute. Previously, I was afraid of death more than anything in the world, but now I understand that this is not the highest form of punishment for a person, now every day I look at the office scissors in my shelf and think what a sweet death it will be, and pain does not scare me. Also, I can no longer relate normally to society as before, because dozens of people just like a collective mind at one moment, as if at the snap of a finger, decided to torment me to the point of madness every day. I existed like this for several years, and this shitty society just looked on. I have a question: why in our society are cruel, sadistic people considered normal, I mean that everyone sees what scum they are, but no one condemns them, although they are worse than murderers. How disgusting it is when there is an outcast in society, and everyone treats him like trash, just because he is simply bad at communicating with people, while he has not done anything bad to anyone."

I think I'm depressed but I don't need to be depressed tho I have a comfortable life, I have great friends , I'm  doing good academically. So there is no reason to be depressed right?? If tell anyone I'm depressed, they ask why are you depressed. I can't give them a answer. I ask my self am I trying to attention seeking ? At this rate I feel like I'm just doing what ever I suppose to do, I feel like I'm not in my body anymore. I'm just spectator. I feel like I'll feel better I could die. Recently I've been thinking about ending it frequently. \n\nEdit : thank you everyone for the kind words and the encouragements . It's actually my birthday today and I was gonna end it. Honestly, I went to my sister's home last night to see my niece and stayed there for the night. My niece is almost 2 years old and climbed on to my bed and woke me idk if she knew I was sad or depressed, she gave me kisses and hugs idk after that I thought about the things everyone commented . lm just sitting at my home now. I kinda feel confused. But again thank you for understanding.",

Depression is not just for the poor or the sick or the lonely. Anyone can suffer for it and those feelings are valid, regardless of your life’s circumstances. \n\nHere’s what I really want you to know. You are important. There is only one YOU in the world. Whether or not you realize it, the world needs you. You have a special purpose meant only for you. Stay. It takes courage I know, but stay anyway. You are so young and I truly believe you have an incredible life ahead of you. \n\nIf it’s something you truly don’t believe will get better without additional resources that your country doesn’t offer, maybe even consider moving to a different country (I know that’s a huge thing and I’m not sure how feasible that is).

        "body": "You shouldn't want to die. Seriously. I've been to the other side and can confidently tell you that getting there through a method like suicide or selfishly seeking out death will land you in the void. Just an endless and timeless nothing where its just you and the mental baggage you bring with you. At least in the world of the living you have distractions and can change for the better. In the void you're forced to hear/stare at your despair forever and it seems immeasurably louder without anything else to drown it out. Just a moment there will have you begging for the tortures of hell and the greatest earthly suffering. Suicide isn't a solution or an escape. It just makes it unfathomably worse and inescapable.\n\nBut you're in the world of the living right now and can change things. Force yourself to sit down with a pen and paper. Write down everything you feel is wrong with your life and everything that makes you feel depressed. You might try to convince yourself that you just are and that its your natural state. Don't listen to that part of yourself, its lying. After you've written down these things start thinking of healthy solutions to change them. Then start doing those things. Its hard at first but the more you work on these healthy solutions the easier it gets. Eventually it won't feel like you're even trying and are just a happy healthy person.\n\nAnd if the void isn't enough of a deterrent then do it for the sake of those who love you. Do it so you don't destroy their lives and rip their hearts out with the most hurtful thing you could possibly do to them. And DO NOT for a second start telling yourself that they'll get over it or that there isn't anyone in your life that would miss you. I promise that those are not true even if you're currently locked into a tunnel vision that keeps you from seeing the truth.\n\nIf you keep trying you WILL get better. :)"

        "body": "\n\nHey guys, this is my first time ever posting to reddit, I have a lot going on and I'm not really sure what I want to get out of this, validation perhaps? I know that I've been trauma dumping on my friends, my partner and some of my family for a long time, and it's really not fair on them to be doing it so much as I'm sure it stresses them out seeing me struggle and not knowing how to help me.\n\nI'll start by saying, there are some things I may brush over, my writing may be disorganised and jumbled, I'm just going to type away try to get the gist of everything out.I'm happy to answer questions and elaborate on things in better detail if anyone wishes to know more I may take a while to reply but I'm an open book, heart on my sleeve type of guy, I have been my whole life. I've been in and out of therapy since year 7, with diagnosis' of: Depression, Generalised Anxiety, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Disorder and now recently getting back into therapy, my therapist thinks it's probably C-PTSD and ADHD.   \n\n(Trigger Warning)  \n\nI'm a 26 year old Australian (M) with a long history of mental health problems. I'm fairly certain I was molested or exposed to sex from a very young age, I had my first somewhat sexual experience with a girl my age when I was about 5 or 6 years old, I'm not sure who instigated that out of the two of us but it was really weird, I'm not sure why I was attempting that so young. I had reoccurring nightmares in childhood of a woman getting uncomfortably close to me but that's about all I can remember, I think my brain did a good job of blocking whatever that was out of my memory. I know that I've always felt uncomfortable when adults would hug/kiss me, I still feel this way, especially with my mother. \n\nI was a sensitive kid and I'm a sensitive adult, I'm very empathetic and have been since I was a kid. I'm a good listener, and I've constantly been told throughout life, \"I don't know what it is about you but I feel like I can talk to you about anything and you don't judge me\" I was a somewhat bright kid, I loved reading, but I struggled with staying focused, and I started suicidal ideation around the age of 10 and going to a catholic school, my thoughts of suicide worried them a lot and I was made to speak with the school nun quite a few times about my problems.\n\n I was bullied in school quite a bit, mostly for being skinny or weird. It probably didn't help that my family moved around a lot during my childhood, so I always had to deal with being the new kid. \n\nMy parents weren't by any stretch horrible, but fuck did they invalidate the shit out of me and convinced me that everything I wanted to try, I'd fail at it or not like it ie; Jobs and Education, all while telling me how intelligent they think I am, it has been such a head fuck.  I know they think they have tried their best over the years with me and my siblings, but every member of my family suffer from some form of mental illness so I give them the benefit of the doubt majority of the time, I guess to the detriment of my own wants and needs, I people please a lot, mostly because I feel strong need to be accepted or liked by people. In saying that, I really do wish my parents were open to going to therapy for themselves, I don't think they quite understand how their problems have affected us kids. I don't think that will ever happen, but it's nice to imagine. My mum always played the \"Well I'm just a bad mother card\" and she became an alcoholic after her father died from alcoholism when I was 14 and still drinks today she also smokes pot, but I think that has been the case her whole life. As for Dad, he drinks, but not as much, he smokes weed and has for his whole life as well. Dang if I ever so as criticised my father, I'd end up in a full blown domestic, which happened a lot, quite a lot of police interventions over the years, one so bad that they placed an intervention order on the two of us and I wasn't able to contact him for a year. My Dad grew up without a father and has ADHD, so he was always a fun friend, and not really a supportive father and funnily enough from a young age I played therapist to my dads problems. Over the past couple of years I've started to put two and two together and I'm fairly certain he is vulnerable narcissist. Everyone bar my best friend and partner can't wrap their head around the fact that he was so horrible behind closed doors, it made me so upset to see him be so nice to everyone else in public, only to come home and treat us kids like dirt. He used to tell me and my older brother that he didn't want kids, that he did it for mum, and that their relationship was problem free before us kids came along. I used to look up to my older brother, he was my idol, and he used to treat me like he hated me in childhood and adolescence, nothing I ever did was good enough, I wanted to be like him and he hated it, I wanted to be myself and he thought I was a dickhead.   When I got into high school, I struggled with focusing so much that I lashed out and left class a lot. I started smoking cigarettes, drinking and having sex at 13.\n\n My best friend who I met in grade 6 on the day I moved to the town I'm still in, was raised by heroin/benzo/methamphetamine addicts/dealers, so I spent a lot of time surrounded by a lot of addicts, I wasn't too fazed by it, there was some scary moments, but given that I wasn't judgemental and was curious, I often had conversations with some pretty bad people who shared a lot with me, from everyday people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time, to people who had been in and out of jail for murder and drug offences, even talking to those people at times I still empathised with them as fucked as that sounds. Years later I would see some of my school mates there. I empathised with my mate, he often dealt with neglect because of their addictions and I wanted to be there for him through those times. He wasn't a good friend to me over the years, and still isn't most of the time. \n\n  \n By the age of 12 I was I was already deeply depressed and anxious, I began laughing off problems and my peers seemed to get kick out of that, I guess that's when the people pleasing began and the bullying stopped. By age 14 I was recreationally smoking pot with my friends along with parties and drinking, my parents weren't happy about it but they allowed it under the shitty advice of their doctor at the time. By age 15 I was smoking pot with my parents, they supplied it to me along with supporting my addiction to cigarettes although occasionally they would cut the supply randomly, and treated me like shit when I my withdrawals kicked in.  \n\n(Trigger Warning) \n\nThis is where the shit really hit the fan.\n\nAt the end of year 10 at the age of 15 I was friends with a couple dudes who I considered best friends at the time, they had met some people on Xbox Live. They decided to come to town and we met them and they seemed cool, we smoked pot and drank to together. A few months later my mates asked me to come along to go see them in their town so off we went. For the first day we just hung out and smoked pot and drank a little. That night the two guys that we visited invited a couple of girl mates around, I was told that one of the girls was single and that I should cuddle up to her, I was very promiscuous at this point so I didn't really question that too much. I wasn't actually too keen on this girl, I felt weird and uncomfortable to begin with upon meeting her. Thy put a movie on and this girl kind of had her way with me I guess. The next day, after waking up my mate from out of town came into the room and franticly told us to get dressed and that we all had to leave the house, that this girls boyfriend was going to run through the house if we were there. We went to a park and hid for a little bit, with the girl who now suddenly had a boyfriend. After a while, a car pulled up on the street, and out came this 19 year old guy and his friend, full sprinting at us with a knife in his hand. We all scattered and he caught up to me and the other friend from this town, in between us a car. He screamed at us saying which one is (My name) whilst we ran around this car to avoid him. We both lied and said it wasn't me so he ran back towards the others whilst we ran for it, in the suburbs of this city, until we got back to my mates house, the relief I felt when getting to the front door, thinking I was safe. Right as we went to step foot in his house my friend got a phone call from this guy, saying bring (My name) back right now, that he just wanted to talk and if I didn't come back he was going to start stabbing the others. I practically begged my friend not to make me go back but he wasn't having it, so we walked back to this park, and as soon as I got over to the group of them, before I could even get a word out, he started to beat the shit out of me, knife in hand. I cried, begged and pleaded, hid behind my friends to get away, didn't fight back, and he just kept getting me to the ground, stomping and kicking at me all whilst he was telling me that I was going to die. It went on for ages, to the point that his friend actually stopped him and said I'd had enough. But he wasn't done, he then picked me up, marched me back to the house we were staying at, and told me I was going to give him everything I had, all while holding this knife to my neck. We were almost back to the house, when he got a phone call, some of his mates were coming to get him. He then proceed to make me lay down on the middle of the road and kiss his feet, only to stomp the back of my head into the asphalt. The car pulled up, a car load of people, and he got in and left. My parents made the 6 hour drive to come get me as soon as I called them about it. \n\nI was home for about two weeks, with a good friend going to score some pot at night when a car full of people stalked us, cornered us in an alleyway and robbed us. \n\nAfter of this happened I was fucked up, I'm still fucked up, I still have nightmares and trouble sleeping, difficulty trusting other people and even myself. \n\nI was put on seroquel, which completely fucked my schooling, I dropped out of year 11. I had friends who got a kick out of making me walk home at night after smoking pot, making me walk the streets alone and sending me on goose chases because they seemed to think it was hilarious that I was freaking out so much about it. One of those being my still current best friend, another who I considered a best friend.\n\nI had a girlfriend at the time, who I was absolutely in love with, who had to deal with my post trauma trust issues and irritability, I loved her so much, she dealt with me venting a lot, about my trauma and my drug addicted best mate. I had to break up with her because I couldn't put her through the bullshit anymore, I did it for her own mental health, and also my own, I had to learn to navigate it on my own. The only way I could get her to accept the break up was to tell her I didn't love her, an absolute lie. \n\nThe friend I considered a best friend, who was there for me the day I got back from the assault  was dealing with a heroin addiction that I was unaware of for some time and substance abuse with a lot of different drugs, I along with our friend group started experimenting with LSD and other drugs from the silk road, even some shifty research chemicals. He was a very very intelligent guy, mildly narcisstic,  but he was very good at pretending everything was fine, he rarely talked about his feelings. His ex partner and myself are among the only people he knew that he took his mask off for. He came over one day and admitted to using heroin and admitted he'd used a few hours before coming over. I got angry and told him to leave. That was the last time I ever saw him. We spoke a couple times over the next couple years and I was apologetic for pushing him away, told him that I'd always be there for him, and 6 months later he was dead. Overdosed. I'd already had a few friends die to suicide at that point, but when he died I truly broke. \n\nFast forward to 8 months ago, another really fucking good mate of mine died from an overdose of script opioids. He had moved away years before that to \"Get away from the drugs\"  and get his life together, none of us knew his addiction got worse there. So it was a real shock to us. I became more depressed than I'd even been in my life, I couldn't leave my bed for weeks.\n\nWe had a gathering a couple of weeks after his passing, at an old older friends house that we used to party at, it was sort of a halfway home for a lot of us in our teenage years. We discussed a lot of things, we got onto the topic of my ex, who till this day, is with an acquaintance of mine. I was then told that the first mate who overdosed, had actually gone and fucked my ex right after we broke up. This guy who I mourned over for years, cleaned his grave monthly, felt guilt over, backstabbed me. My ex knowing how much I loved him, worried every night over, went to him and fucked him, I don't know how to feel about it anymore, I'm so confused. \n\nAll of this has completely fucked my progress in life, I can't hold jobs, I'm pretty much constantly analysing people, and myself. I've started studying so many times and dropped out.  I still have major trust issues and paranoia, on my own I've learnt to internalise this instead of project it. I suffer with substance abuse problems still. I'm faced with years of therapy that I can't afford, a ten session mental health care plan just doesn't cut it when I'm going to probably need hundreds of sessions to reverse this. Those first ten sessions could quite easily and more than likely will be used up on my \"History\" because I have so much of it. I honestly feel like I will never feel joy or pleasure in my life, I'll always be haunted by nightmares, that my life is doomed to be a constant uphill battle. \n\nI'm sorry for the trauma dump, I understand that the internet is a pretty silly place to vent, but I don't really have great support in my life at the moment. The only reason I'm still here is because of my partner. She's so patient with me, and loving towards me despite all of the negatives. She just struggles with communication, but I know she loves me very much, even if I don't love myself, or can't show up for her at times.\nI can barely show up for myself, constantly over analysing, ruminating, investigating, worrying and stuck in self pity, having nightmares every night, sleep deprived, falling down the drug rabbit hole, leaving jobs, being a really good friend sometimes and being a terrible one at other times, being paranoid over small interactions, feeling like everyone must see how pathetic I am. \nIt's so exhausting, when people tell me that life gets better, that once I put in the work I will be better, I don't know what feeling better even looks like, I don't believe it, and if I ever got to that place, I'd feel guilty, undeserving and beat myself back into the place I'm in. \n\nI\n\n",

        "body": "How’s your motivation? \n\nWhen I get into a depressive spiral, or the meds I’m taking aren’t working - I loose all my energy and can barely get out of bed/have a shower let alone go out to work or uni. I completely isolate myself and stop talking to people because it simply takes too much out of my ‘social battery’ and I feel physically exhausted from interactions. \n\nDo you still feel like going to school? Can you still get up and do things on a daily routine that you normally would, but you just don’t want to go to school? How’s your relationships with people there, are certain people making you not want to go? Are there any issues? \n\nIt could be an issue with your meds not working, not having the right dosage or just on the wrong medication. It could be to do with relationships and certain people or subjects that are making you not want to go.\n\nThe difference between being lazy and having a medical condition are hard to distinguish between. \n\nUsually for me- if it’s just being lazy, I think “oh I could go to uni today… but I’m just going to stay home and play games/do anything other than my work because “it’s boring” or “I don’t really need to go to this class”. Whereas having a mental condition impacting me, my thought are more “i want to go, but my body/brain is telling me it’s impossible..” and I can barely function doing other things let alone go out anywhere. \n\n(I’m not a doctor, this is just from personal experience and everyone is subject to them differently)\n\nEDIT: I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder. However I saw a psychiatrist this year and turns out I’m actually having ADHD, autism and bipolar. Sometimes, the medical condition you think you have turns out to be something that’s completely different (autism and adhd can present as depression/anxiety when left untreated- maybe this could be the case here too?)"

And recent my brother has lost his baby mama in a bad accident and now my whole family is fighting and I just feel like I'm useless again, like I'm not strong enough to handle the situation or help in any way, maybe I'm selfish but I want to help everyone else befor myself. Idk maybe I just need someone to help me first. This is just all my thoughts rn, like everyday I'll be on my way to work and think about hitting the gas till I collide with an 18 wheeler, I don't want to hurt myself but I can't seem to help these feeling I'm having, my days off are spend doing nothing but playing games and listen to music I don't have to motivate to get help mainly because I work nights and I have to make my self even more sleep deprived to do anything. I don't know how to handle myself. My roommates as well I hear them fight all the time and I hear my male roommate cry all the time because his family issues and it hurts me to hear it I hate seeing evey single person in my life fight cry and not be happy but I can't seem to do anything about it idk what to do anymore",

I have a sibling who is bipolar and has manic episodes that land him in the hospital, so in a way this actually does resonate with me. It’s the worst thing having to watch a sinking go through crisis. I’ve had to come to the conclusion that there’s only so much my family and I can do.

We knew there was a very big issue but the doctors said legally their was only so much they could do with the information he was giving them. At least that’s my experience with someone who had dangerous mania (dangerous to themselves mainly). We eventually had to get a mental health professional emergency line person to go to his house and they were able to 302 him. \n\nSide note for OP. if there are any mental health lines like that around u, that isn’t 911, id recommend reaching out to them, especially during an aggressive episode. Sometimes they do take a bit longer, so if it’s completely urgent 911 is prob the best way to go."

I also don’t want to talk to anyone about it because I know how much problems this could give her (especially with her parents) and she has asked me many times not to talk to anyone about her problems.

The only advice I can suggest really is getting professional help. She is clearly suffering from depression and unresolved trauma. It is hard to see clearly when you have a dark cloud following you 24/7. I really hope that she is able to find peace and happiness within. Supporting a loved one with mental health issues is not easy and it can definitely affect your mental health too, so make sure you are taking care of yourself to and seeking the support you need. Do you trust your parents enough to open up to them? You don't have to go into detail too much but maybe talking to someone you trust could help. I know she doesn't want you talking to anyone about it but it must be hard dealing with this alone. You're brave and strong for even making this post. I truly hope things work out. Wish you all the best and good luck! ❤️"

I would video her flipping out saying she's gonna hurt herself and get her help call 911 as suicide deff is no joke and alot of these meds they put us on have suicidal tendencies for bad effects or not taking it properly......the best help you can do unfortunately is push her to go to a psych or therapy.....if she tries to hurt herself or mentions it DO NOT BE AFRAID TO CALL 911 AS YOU DONT KNOW HER MIND FRAME THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT you love your gf right? Then you want her to get better and what your dealing with is not healthy at all"

I don't want to disclose anything I've done (it's not illegal or anything don't worry), but in general just your run of the mill maybe morally questionable actions by a teenager.\n\nThe scary part is, I feel genuinely no guilt whatsoever from this. I'm somewhat worried I'm developing some sort of NPD. My only worry is getting caught ever, I don't really care about how would it affected others. (btw, these are not offenses that directly harm others, stealing scamming nothing like that).\n\nEven when I'm not doing something wrong, I'm always only thinking about myself. Anything I do is only with concern to myself (with maybe the exception of my mom, as I love her a lot). But other than that, I'm usually just concerned with maximizing my own outcomes.\n\nThe overall thing is, concerning religion, I have tried many times to believe and pray, it never works. I never end up believing. I just can't make myself, it's a lie if I try. I'm too science focused to think that God could exist. Maybe he does, but my mind is too realistic for that.\n\nOverall I'm struggling to develop a sense of moral(ity) values overall, and feel like it's making me feel kind of weird overall. I don't like feeling like this. I want to be a better person.",

        "body": "I (27F) have been with my partner (26M) for almost four years now. When I first met him he was very loving, very affectionate and very emotional with me. I never knew he struggled so deeply with mental health until about 2/3 months into our relationship when he cheated on me for the first time. Since that it has been terrible and continues to be every single day. He ended up cheating our entire relationship until we broke up for about 6 months and parted ways. \n\nWe came back together under the premise things would be different and they haven’t changed at all. But, this time, he is blaming everything on his mental health. He struggles with GAD, OCD, and depression. He says he cannot love me or show me love or show me affection because of how terrible he feels on a day to day basis. He says he is barely surviving life. I ask how I can help, how I can support him or what I can do and he tells me nothing. He barely speaks to me, he’s extremely cold and unloving and shows me little to no affection, but assures me that he thinks this will get better with time and him figuring out his medication. He just recently started taking Lexapro again after weaning off of 20mg that he took for 3/4 years. He also has issues with his testosterone and believes that causes him issues with his mental health as well. \n\nHe’s admitted to love bombing me, to gas lighting me, etc and I’m sure at this point you’re wondering why I’m still with this man. \n\nI just genuinely care for and love him and want to try to support him as best as possible but feel lost. How do I support him when he does not care for me or my feelings at all? Is it normal for someone who suffers from mental health so much to be so closed off / self centered? How do I feel loved and supported as well or communicate that I need to feel these ways if he says he can’t put himself into me right now? Everything about this is confusing and hard. ",

        "body": "Hi, I'm a 16 year old and my life is going downhill day by day. imp not very good in English so please bear with me. I've thought about expressing my life in reddit but i never actually attempted it because i don't usually use social media that much\n\nTo give you a little background information I've always been a shy kid i never used to talk to other kids so i was pretty lonely most my times but its not that big of an issue, I think that its quite normal. I started talking in grade 4 and became class rep and started socializing not like a popular student but the very least a student who is known by my classmates which was a huge deal for me at that time. my mom changed schools in my 6th grade i was devastated i finally had some friends i cried and pleaded not to change school ( she did it for my best, the new school had great infrastructure and syllabus) when i went to my new school s usual i was silent for around the whole year. people started to notice me because of my knowledge i would answer all questions in math and science so i was very happy and became somewhat known to others. grade 7 (age 12) started, everything became hell, at first i started talking more and got 2 friend (lets call Abby whos not the best kind of evil and the other rose who was good) but at that time i didn't know. apparently a boy liked me and every single person told me abt it. i was getting more recognition which was very new. when everyone asked me i said no because i had no interest or any feelings towards him but we used to talk in grade 6. this is where i think i made the biggest mistake, when rose asked me abt that boy (lets call him jimmy) and whether i liked him i said i don't know and i smiled. now that i think abt it its obviously wrong but at that time i din=dnt know and i was very happy so smile a lot. rose went to his class and told her friend which then spread like crazy that i liked him. at that point i was too late i didn't know what to do or who to say this to if i had said that i didn't like him i thought everyone would hate me and i will become a nobody. so the time came when he proposed to me infront of everyone in the corridor i smiled and said yes. i was scared to say that i didn't and we started dating. jimmy is a typical sweet boy whos shy when he sees me smile like he hit the jackpot and used to blush a lot. he took care of me very well to. i felt guilty a sweet boy like him doesn't deserve to be with a person who didn't love him. words spread quickly and everyone went crazy. Abby liked him which i didn't know so she started crying and then acting strange towards me. my brother and i studied in the same school so when he heard abt this he was upset. a lot of rumors spread i was very very unhappy not a singe person whom i could trust but i was friends with rose and she seems nice innocent straightforward and honest. this is all my fault, i ruined my life and well as jimmy the sweet angel. i deserve karma but what i experience next is a little too much i obviously did wrong things but that doesn't mean i deserved such thing. all his friends and others told bad things abt me and i was scared. abby started intervening our relationship stating he doesn't like me or that jimmy had asked my Instagram password from her which is not true at all. every person i saw thought abt me only as a person in a relationship with jimmy. i was hurt i couldn't say that i didn't love jimmy, he would do anything for me but i couldn't love him as he deserved i tried so hard but couldn't ive left some other details if you're interested ill make  a new post. for now lets continue, i dont think im that pretty, wont say ugly or average. had some strong features so i think lot of them liked me. please dont think of me as a pick me when i say this, but i wish that no one liked me, i couldn't talk to people without them being attracted to me. one guy lets call him Isaiah, i used to talk to everyone literally every single person, including Isaiah. one day she expressed to me that she loved him i politely said that i didnt and am in a relationship with jimmy. he started becoming crazy and told everyone to not speak to me and to my surprise no one did i was shocked including the girls. in the other section a girl lets call her Claire whom ive never talked to suddenly didn't like me and helped Isiah to get people to stop talking to me. i understood every single person were trash and stopped talking. one guy(guy 1) alone came up to me and said that okay we all are friends no need for others to say whether i should talk or not im very grateful towards his action.\n\ncovid hit and during lockdown i spoke with rose that guy 1. jimmy had broken his tablet and couldn't communicate with me. i waited. my grandma was very ill so we had a lot of fight in our house so told rose that i couldnt speak with her for a few week and i became inactive in Instagram. i was alone with no contact for aound 3 months, i started thinking its better to be alone so my mindset completely changed. jimmy texted me and informed me abt his situation and that point i thought of letting go him too. later i ignored everyone(so many others guys did same as Isaiah but i wont say it here if you want then ill make a new post) all this broke my mental peace. time passed by grade 8 came i started to ignore jimmy as i thought people started rumors because jimmy told his friends i held a grudge towards him. he kept texting me, i wanted to say im very sorry and i was happy with you but i hate everything i feel empty and i dont think ilkl give back love to you but i couldnt, maybe i deserved the bad things now that im saying all this but please just hear me out. i felt guilty and bad but i couldn't do anything jimmy called and texted me through his friends and i ignored them all (during online classes) grade 9 came by and i spoke to jimmy on the call and explained that well part ways, i still would talk to him if he wasn't with his so called friends whom i hate so much. i started speaking to rose and became friends again we used to studying calls all day. but she always said that i would leave her because i didn't talk to her in lockdown, i was hurt but i guess she was true but i had my reasons and stil had no one to express this to literally no one in my life knows abt this. one guy lets name him William, he proposed to me and i said no but still spoke to him which now when i think is wrong. she would be such a creep, would have my photos in his wallpaper and show everyone in my class(boys) when they went to play soccer in grounds and would text me infront of them and much more. i was hurt, i told him to delete he said he did but i heard from others i was upset, i dont know how to say but a lot happened, he started following me when i walked home and wait in nearby shops with his friends, saying abt this is making my heart hurt. many things happened and i cried to rose but i dont think she acknowledged it very well. i thought maybe shes not that kind of person to console but when something happened to  between her other friends love relationship she would always help, i felt unloved. i used to cry everyday thinking abt things happened to me and how i made jimmy suffer. Everyone sopke about me everyday and i was disgusted.\n\n Rose's cousin lets call him devil absolute devil, he spoke to me when i was at me lowest point still in grade 9 i was happy someone acknowledged my feelings of course u didn't say everything but still was happy one day he expressed love and affection to me and cared for me i felt full with happiness. later told me he loved me for years and i replied i dont know because i felt loved after years and was happy i told him i didnt know and after 2 days he left me and said reason like im sorry blah blah blah i was shattered felt unloved and depressed. after 5 months he texted me through rose i dint want to speck with him but they both begged me to so i did reply, he texted me a long para of apology and love letter, i felt happy and we started tallking but i was not not love i was just happy that he gave me affection and care but as time passed by we dated (im stupid i ruin my own life) after some time he started becoming possessive and made me stop talking to others(i myself spoke to a very few people because of my trauma but then this made it worse) he projected his insecurity and i was all alone felt secluded and ugly. this went on for 1 whole year, i couldn't leave him he would call my mom and do all toxic stuffs and i was alone so i thought it was better than being by myself he asked for nudes and i said no then he started fighting left me alone this was when i was 14 so again being afraid of loneliness i sent it to him. i felt like trash ugly disgusting but i started living through it grade 10 came everything made him mad if i spoke to a guy he'd be mad an girl he'd be mad if i see the make teacher he'd be mad i dont want to get in so much detail as im tearing up rn full grade 10 i spoke to no one and cried daily bcuz he would argue and hurt me mentally. grade 11 started i stood for school pupil leader and won so i started speaking to others but everyone spoke abt me i was scared to speak after long time i couldn't speak properly i would be shivering. jimmy also became a pupil leader, and we had to do a task of maintain the halls as the council members so i started talking to the sweet boy, he was hurt i felt sad that he was unhappy because of me, if not he'd be the happiest sweetest person ever. we started talking more and more, others began to notice and spread rumors and so is topped talking in school and call him after school, i didn't say this to the devil and he came to know and stopped talking to me i felt free happy i could do anything eat whenever i want sleep whenever i want do whatever i want literal freedom but still i hate that school and everyone there and finally made new friends with seniors and with jimmy and had the courage so broke it off with him 2023 October its been almost 6 months and im happy but today my brother went through my phone and saw those nudes and advised me i started crying he is correct and said that he would take care of those pictures by calling them without context and deleting them but i felt very sentimental confronting abt this i was traumatized now he's asking me to stop talking to jimmy as sent him fit checks and stuff because he doesn't trust him everything is correct but he's the sweetest soul i used to scared that the devil would leak my pics but i forgot abt it now I'm in a tough spot exam is tomorrow and I'm very scared he took my phone with I'm in a mental breakdown please advise me what to do",

        "body": "TW: self harm/suicidal thoughts, substance abuse, physical injuries \n\nI’m welcoming all experiences or advice from anyone who has gone through or requested someone go through an involuntary psychiatric hold. I am really struggling whether or not to request one for my brother because he is at the point of refusing help but is hurting himself and  threatening suicide. Our mom doesn’t  want me to request out of fear of what he might go through. He’s PA based- Montgomery County/Philadelphia. \n\nPlease feel free to skip over the explanation of the situation if substance abuse wasn’t an issue but you want to share on the experience. I hope the following is allowed in this sub.\n\nI really don’t want to petition for a hold, but my brother who has struggled with mental health issues and opiates off and on for over 10 years and now fentanyl/xylazine/tranquilizers is back at my moms house. He is severely under weight, not taking care of himself, talking about suicide, and is refusing to get any kind of help. He’s been to treatment willingly about 10 times with periods of sobriety, but now is saying it’s too hard with the new mix of opioid street replacements listed above, and that he’s tried to get clean so many times before that he just wants us to let go and let him die at this point. \n\nAs someone who has also always struggled with issues from our childhood as well, I don’t want to force him to do anything. I love him so much and he is hurting, but he’s very much a danger to himself and rationally if he’s not forced help in the moment, he’s not going to make it. Especially because his arms are severely torn up and infected. \n\nI know to many it sounds like a no brainer to just go for it, but I’ve called their local and Philly Crisis Lines (Temple U Hospital was the most helpful) and I was told to not mention his arms or substance abuse when I call back or they won’t involuntarily evaluate him. But once he’s admitted, he’ll need detox meds and medical assistance, possibly surgery, which he can refuse. On one hand, I just feel like I’ll be torturing him if an involuntary hold is issued and he’s just held 3-5 days with no guaranteed medical assistance, but on the other hand, I  don’t see any other way to get him help and not just have him die slowly.\n\nI really just don’t know what to do as it seems like anyone struggling with mental health and substance abuse won’t get the same consideration or treatment as someone just struggling with mental health. I’m scared to make things worse so any insight is greatly appreciated. I’m done rambling now and if you made it this far, thank you so much. \n",

Overall my life is pretty fun and exciting, but I still find myself suffered from FOMO every single time I open an app and see people doing stuff while I’m at home. I’m a single, childless woman in grad school currently, and I find myself envying nearly everyone that I see online. I envy people that are younger than me for their youth and freedom, and I envy people that are older than me for their exciting careers and loving spouses/kids. Almost all of the content that I consume makes me feel bad for one reason or another, and scrolling doesn’t really give me a sense or relaxation or gratification like it used to.\n\nI really think that I need to cut back on my social media consumption for my mental health, however I’m struggling to find something else to take its place. For others that have done a social media detox, what do you do to relax in your free time?? Do you play games?? Pick up a book?? Call people?? I also have adhd, so it would be awesome if I could find something that can give relatively quick gratification and can engage my brain when it’s feeling overstimulated. ",

I sat there laughing until i was crying in pain and even then i felt like i couldnt stop. i felt like my body was squeezing in on itself and i couldnt stop shaking but i felt so happy. before yesterday there were some things like during the day i see things in my peripheral vision and when i look to see them they arent there even when i know i saw them and i keep hearing my mom or my friend call for me but when i go to them they say they arent. i feel like there are always eyes on me and it makes me nervous all the time. i dont know if this has anything to do with it but ive been forgetting things so easily and its frustrating. I keep getting thoughts of disturbing things cutting or burning myself and especially cannibalism. it feels weird to say but cannibalism has been on my mind a lot in a very disturbing way along with some other things. stress hasnt been a super big thing in my life until these things started now i just feel super anxious and stressed all of the time. I tried looking up what might be wrong but i cant find anything so it would be very nice if someone could help.",

She and my dad only really stayed together because she was pregnant with my sister. Her life was pretty good for ~12 years after my sister and I were born. Then her relationship with my sister went to shit. Then her sister died. Then she got MS. Then she found a man she really loved who she got engaged to until a drunk argument stemming from trust issues caused by the men she was with in highschool got ended it. After that my dad was her only support but they've always had a bit of bad blood between them and today she flat out said she hated him. I'm the only reason she's still alive, so much so she wants me to kill myself with her but I won't. But I don't want my mom to just continue suffering for the sake of me, I want her to find happiness and she came so close. She never asked me do it with her so I'm worried she's somewhere else right now. She's lived such a fucked up life she's never gotten to truly experience it and I'm really worried she never will. I'm not ready for my mom to die, I'm only 14, I don't have enough memories or time spent with her yet. I've never had a drink with her. I don't know her favorite show. I just want her to be happy.",

I know rationally this isn't true, but the non logic part of my brain keeps insisting that its true.  I'm not talking about feeling as if I don't exist.  Depersonalization or Derealization disorders are what I keep getting in search results, and that isn't what I'm feeling.  I know I exist, and I don't feel as if I experience life from the outside.  I just feel like people completely forget me once I'm not there, and I don't cross their mind again until the next time I see or get in contact with them.  \n\n\nI know there is plenty of evidence this isn't true, like people contacting me first, or buying me gifts, or telling me they thought of me during that time away.  Logically I have no reason to feel this way, yet I do.  What i really want to know is how common this is, if this logic flaw has a name associated with it, and if there is something I can do to stop feeling this way. ",

I’m just always so afraid I hate it I hate being a coward, he also sat me down and I told him abt my situation and he understood me.

As for the anxiety, I would try a few breathing techniques, absolutely do not skip meals if possible, and while it may seem easy to say and harder to do, you are not on the earth to please everyone. Do well for yourself and ignore negative people.\n\nPanic attacks are not a pleasant experience, but they won't harm you, they'll just make you feel uncomfortable for a little while. I find music is a good way to help center myself when I feel a little out of control. \n\nAbsolutely DO NOT let anyone hit you, ever. Take self defense classes and knock that uncle on his ass if he tries that shit again, it'll also help build confidence and balance.\n\nSince I'm not your therapist, this is just random advice to take or leave, I would suggest CBT cognitive behavioral therapy, it could be really helpful. Do see your primary care physician and maybe have them write you a note that allows for you to be excused to go see your school nurse or counselor, when you feel too nervous or anxious to be in class.\n\nMost importantly, look after yourself for you, do well for you and always ALWAYS ask for help when you need it... Since you're here, it's a good first step, but do ask for help IRL too... Best of luck and take care... 🍀🤞"

Eventually we wanted to move back to our home state but after some family drama, we decided we would prefer being back where I went to grad school.\n\nNow it's been over 10 years and I have never actually made it into a job that my degree was for. Between the move and emotional trauma of what happened to my family, I couldn't find the right position. I have full time work but it's not what I want to do.\n\nWe now have a child and we recently bought a house, but I am suddenly very aware of how worthless it all feels. I miss all my friends, I miss my career choice, and most of all I simply miss that feeling of being home.\n\nI am tremendously homesick and it's really affecting me mentally. I don't know how to move on from this feeing. I will skip the details of the family drama, but imagine finding the worst skeleton in your family's closet and potentially double it. On top of that I have had a very close family member die when I was younger so just being at home brings back painful memories. \n\nTo top it off, I really like my wife's family and they seem more like parents than mine. So being in their house feels comforting and warm. But I can't bring myself to think about moving home as it's pretty rural and kind of a dead end for our work fields. Plues my wife has a great job and our toddler loves his school.\n\nAny suggestions? This feeling is severally impacting my mental state and I am worried I will make a reckless decision. ",

This might be a long one folks, filled with unnecessary blabbering.\n\nI am 14, and will be 15 in a couple months or so. I live with my mum, stepdad, two siblings and our dog. I have a group of friends I hang out with, I have classes I enjoy in school, I'm improving my attendance (whitch I have had trouble with often throughout school), I should be happy. I love my family, I love my friends, I have stuff to keep me occupied and I'm able to remind myself sometimes that what the scales tell me doesn't matter, what matters is that I'm comfortable in my body.\n\nI'm not sure why, but for as long as I can remember, I've made a habit of not sharing my feelings and bottling it up to adress later, and I think it's probably the cause of alot of the problems I have.\n\nFor quite a few months now, I've been having suicidal thoughts. I planned when exactly I'm going to kill myself, and when I'm in my feelings I write up draft suicide letters in my notes app. I've convinced myself to atleast live to 28. Whitch means I still have ages of this left. And, due to a lack of other ways to cope with my everlasting and unexplainable misery, I started to 'cut myself' again from early this year.\n\nI put that in apostrophes because I don't like describing it as cutting myself or self harming or whatever. It feels wrong to talk about something so loosely when people genuinely struggle with such things. I don't even have a reason for doing it other than the first time I tried it, back in October last year (I have a much easier method now), it made me feel better. The reason I tried in the first place was because, I'm not sure why, but I was getting some pretty concerning (or atleast to me at the time) intrusive thoughts as I stood in the kitchen cleaning my nose peircing.\n\nI have this plan. This plan that's not going to benifit me for a while yet, but a plan atleast.\nMy plan is, because I don't feel comfortable talking to anyone I know personally about this, I will wait untill I move out and then start researching therapy and will try to find a therapist to go to. The reason I want to wait so long is because, from what I can tell, if I were to say to a therapist that I plan to commit suicide one day and that I 'cut myself', they would have to tell my mum.\nNow, my mum is one of the loveliest people I know, and I know she wouldn't be at all unsupportive of me regardless of what its about, my problem is just that, as an autistic person, I have never really dealt well with change, and I don't exactly fare well in awkward social situations. So, knowing how my mum would react, I'd rather not risk her worrying or anything. Looking after me without knowing I hurt myself and stuff is a chore enough and I love her to pieces. She already has enough to stress about normally as it is.\n\nThe question in the title, \"What counts?\" is a question I always seem to wonder when thinking about weather or not what I do may be considered a method of self harm. I would never try to invalidate another person's experience with such matteres, but always seem to find ways to deny any connection when it comes to myself and self harming. I always feel guilty even considering that I may be self harming, as I feel it diminishes the experiences of others who have suffered with self harm.\n\nIs it worth waiting to seek help?\n\nIf you read all of that, thank you so much. Even without interacting with this post, if you've bothered to read this boring, silly rant from some random and equally silly teenager, I owe you my thanks for hearing what I have said. I hope you have a wonderful day/evening/night and I wish you the best, whoever you are. Goodnight. :)",

I don’t want to live like this always at home and not hanging out with anyone. I want to walk up to everyone and become friends with them but my shyness is holding me back. I hate the way I think. I want to be close with someone . I’m always so quiet and embarrassed about doing anything. I don’t want to have one sided friendships and to follow after different friend groups everyday that want nothing to do with me. I’m always so quiet and thinking if I should say thsi or that that I always end up saying nothing in conversations and being excluded. i don’t want to grow and leave high school alone. I shoukd just kill myself because I do NOT want to deal with this. My shyness is always holding me back. I always get embarrassed at every word I say and how it sounded like and think about it for atleast 2 days. It’s gotten so bad I search up everyday how to be make friends. No advice helps me. I have nobody to tell this about and I’m not planning to see a therapist. I want to tell my mom about this but she thinks I have alot of friends and I dont want to disappoint her. I HATE DEALING WITH MY THOUGHTS I wish I could just get out of my head and just enjoy whats around me instead of sitting still and staying quiet. I dont want to grow up like this. ",

        "body": "\rFor about 5 years now, I've been struggling with my responsibilities, specifically with school. In primary school, after changing schools due to problems in the old one (I think it was 6th grade), I started skipping many days, spending them mostly in front of the computer, chatting with friends, playing games, or watching movies/TV shows or YouTube. It continued like this throughout primary school, and I barely passed my classes, only managing to pass them in the last month twice (I'm proud of passing, though I probably shouldn't be). When I started technical high school, I told myself things would be different. I chose programming, thinking I would learn something that interested me (and initially, it was like that, and maybe it still is, but I'm not even sure anymore). Despite my intentions, the problem resurfaced in the second semester of the first year.\r  \n\r  \nMy mom, after so many issues with me, started taking me to a psychiatrist and psychologist, and it turned out I had (maybe still have, I don't know) depression. She arranged remote schooling for me as a way to rest and gather strength, but even with remote learning, there were difficulties, albeit minor (mostly morning classes). In the second year, I returned to school, and something clicked in me, allowing me to finish the semester with a GPA of 4.12. But right after the first semester, I got stuck at home again and went back to remote learning.\r  \n\r  \nIn the third year (currently), I was on remote learning for the first semester, and it was okay. I even started feeling happy with life this year (or at least I think so), but in the second semester, after returning, I can't even get out of bed in the morning anymore. I'm turning 18, and I'm afraid I'll be struck off the student list, but I still can't bring myself to go to school. Remote learning is supposed to start again on March 24th, but I don't even know if I'll make it until then. I'm still not sure where all my struggles come from. I'm not bullied, I'm not doing as badly as I'm trying, I have friends who worry about me, but I can't talk to them about it.\r  \n\r  \nDuring all these years, a lot has happened in my life outside of school. My mom went through toxic relationships, which also affected me. There was significant poverty at home at times, and family members turned away from my mom, sometimes turning away from me too. My siblings were taken away from my mom, including me, for a month (a month before my 18th birthday).\r  \n\r  \nEven before all the school problems started, I experienced many unpleasant situations, like my father's suicide (I was 7 years old and don't remember him well; he had drug problems and did it after the divorce). I couldn't get along with anyone in kindergarten; I was extremely sensitive and cried a lot, which pushed other kids away, leading to more crying. In primary school (before changing schools), I had many problems with peers and even older students who would taunt me and deliberately annoy me until I cried or tried to attack them, resulting in even more crying. I didn't have a single meaningful relationship until seventh grade. Even after changing schools, things weren't ideal because I was treated as if I were mentally disabled by many people, including teachers.\r  \n\r  \nEven though I don't have many pleasant memories from childhood, I'm currently satisfied with life, although I still lack motivation. I want to know at least why I don't feel any productivity from learning. I love programming, although I'm not sure anymore because I haven't tried programming outside of school. But I can't imagine another industry for myself, so it doesn't matter. I have friends who support me, even though I sometimes let them down. I have a mom who tries her best despite having her own problems. I feel bad for not being able to fulfill my responsibilities, even though I don't have the worst life. I'm scared of the future; I've been asking myself whether I should drop out of school and find a job, but I know my mom would be disappointed, and besides, what about my future then? I tried exercising, but I can't keep it up for more than a week. I tried to stay away from the PC, but it didn't help. When it's a school day, I'm afraid to go to sleep; I don't know where this irrational fear comes from. Similarly, it's midnight now, and instead of sleeping, I'm writing this post on Reddit. When I'm at school, I feel tremendous discomfort, but it's strange; I just don't feel like myself, as if I'm watching myself in third person. There's chaos in my head on the bus; I jump from thought to thought, and I don't even know why it's like that. The walk to the bus stop can be pleasant, but if someone walks behind me, suddenly I can't walk straight, and I don't know why. I doubt I have social anxiety because I'm usually extroverted; maybe I just don't feel comfortable in large groups of people?\r  \n\r  \nI've already forgotten why I decided to write this post here; I guess I'm just curious if anyone is going through something similar, or if anyone has anything interesting to say. Tomorrow, I probably won't go to school again, and my homeroom teacher is already threatening me with penalties. I'm starting to doubt I'll pass to the next grade. If anyone read this entire thing, I'm sorry for writing so strangely; ~~Polish is uncomfortable for me, and I'm tired.~~ (I originally wrote this in polish, but for reasons I decided to post it here, so I used ChatGPT to translate it, maybe I'm just lazy)",

I feel I lost who I was before I started abusing and as much as I want help, I find my self control lacking, thus, starting the cycle again. The dreams and aspirations as well as drive seem to have left me and I feel impostor syndrome in every aspect of my life causing doubt in any relationships or ideals i held closely. These issues, I feel,  I shared with my estranged father and for some reason I feel it's a big trick the world's been pulling on me. I just dont know and at this point I feel I need professional help and before time passes me by and I'm stuck in this loop forever. Really don't care for responses but I do think writing this out is a temporary relief. Theres too much to say and I'm losing the energy to keep dwelling on it. I don't know.

At the very least, you know they will support your self-help journey \n\nI can’t truly tell you when one can fully accept themselves since it is a journey of a life time with you yourself constantly changing - even at rock bottom.

And it has sent him into a spiral. He has been really struggling to sleep and eat. He also has been crying very frequently and he says he doesn’t know why he is crying. And it’s so hard to help him when I have no idea what to do. I tell him over and over that we will figure this out and how much I love him and I’ll always be here for him. But I’m extremely worried. He’s been loosing a lot of weight the last few months around 40 pounds actually. And we both smoke weed everyday. And both in college. But he works a shit ton and is always pushing his limits. He’s stressed about so much and I really need someone’s help on the right words I can say or what I can do to help. I also have issues with eating and mental health but I only ever got therapy about twice and never went back. ",

Seeing how uneducated and unknowledge people are, and seeing how people with zero clue influence others views is very annoying. \n\nWhat helped me was realising that first off, the people that spend hours daily or even minutes hating on individuals, ethnic groups and any other kind of minorities. Is that they are most always dumb, ugly and insecure. Nobody emotionally and mentally satisfied sits there, talking negatively on topics they have no clue about. \n\nThey get their views from extremists, and are dumb enough to believe them and are also dumb enough to lack an understanding of what its like to be in a minority or oppressed group. \n\nFor me, what I do to make me feel better, is educate, the people around me in school and work, aren't all the most intellectual and read these comments from others, and begin to believe its true. So I try to change their mindset, by being kind and willing to talk about (for me being gay). They'll sometimes and not horribly say something a little out of line, and I try to understand them, reason with them but then educate them on why they are wrong. And it works. \n\nYou can't change losers on the internet's mindset, but you can stop others around you from listening to those losers who are predominantly as stated, either or all dumb, ugly and insecure. Also switching off from the internet helps lol and especially don't react or respond to the comments you see, unless they are asking a question, if its pure hate, those individuals are too dumb to save, let them live out their boring lives. Just know especially nowadays there's many more people who are willing to listen and support minorities and oppressed groups. The good thing with hate comments is that positive ones exist too, I'm a white guy, but I and many other of my friends aren't racist, and don't leave hate comments neither listen to them. It may seem like its getting worse in regards to the amount of hate speech online, but its getting better in my views!!!"

        "body": "Taking care of your mental health is super important, just like looking after your physical health. Sometimes, our days can get really overwhelming with stress, anxiety, and all those ups and downs of emotions. But hey, you're not alone in this, and it's totally okay to ask for help when you need it. \n\nHere are some things to keep in mind  - Make sure to take care of yourself by doing things you love and giving yourself breaks when you need them. \n\nBe kind to yourself and understand that it's alright to mess up sometimes. Treat yourself with gentleness. \n\nDon't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or mental health professionals for support. You don't have to face tough times by yourself. \n\nSet boundaries that help you save your energy and focus on what you need. \n\nLook after your physical health by staying active, eating well, and getting enough sleep. \n\nTry to limit your screen time to avoid feeling overwhelmed and to boost your mental well-being. \n\nPractice stress-relief activities like deep breathing, meditation, or doing something you find relaxing. \n\nCelebrate even the small wins, because every little step forward is a step towards better mental health.  \n\nRemember, asking for help and taking care of your mental health shows how strong you are, not how weak. You deserve to put yourself first and live a happy life. There's always hope for brighter days ahead. Let's work together towards better mental health.",

        "body": "Based on your description I can’t say what you’re feeling; could be depression, burnout, lack of self esteem. So I think you should try looking deep within yourself and put a name to your problems. Journal, eat healthy, exercise, sleep, watch something you love, basically do self care to remind yourself how important you are and how life isn’t all bad. Talk to your husband and your parents about how you feel (no shame in asking for help regardless of age). If you believe in a God/higher power I suggest connecting with that belief to understand life outside of yourself. \n\nFigure out what your problem is and work on it. Be happy. You deserve it.\n\nI personally don’t like medication for mental health as well, I know some people say it makes them feel disassociated so consider that as well and talk to your therapist/a doctor to see if that has any impact on your feelings."

I know that your life seems like nothing but negative, but I hope you can learn to change your perspective because I really think it would help you. I used to be like this, too, and still have my moments. I know you see nothing but negativity, but try to think of the positives, even if it’s small. As you said, you have no idea how you got your husband, but you should consider that if he’s such a good guy and picked you, you obviously have a lot to offer and good characteristics. Being in a new country is scary, but try to think of it as an adventure and of all the opportunities you can have when building a new life in a new place. \n\nThere is also nothing wrong for asking for support from your parents at any age. You’re not a failure, you just are focusing on the wrong things. Try working with your therapist on this and talk to your psychiatrist about what’s going on. Maybe you need a different type of therapy and/or different meds? Try joining some club activities/groups to help you meet people. I’d also consider getting a pet, they really do help you not feel alone, bring joy into your life, make you feel needed, and keep you busy with caring for them which makes you feel accomplished for doing so. Work on finding a hobby that brings you joy. For me, I like making pottery and sculptures. I hope all of this helps, even if it’s only a little 💖"

For what it’s worth, I’m really sorry you’re having such a hard time. As someone else mentioned, journaling is great. Different methods of it as well. I like to make entries from a rational mindset and make different entries for my emotional mind. That tends to kinda bind them together a little, or at least helps define a link between the two like a pattern. That’s self-discovery, so it might help you find something that sparks in your mind.\n\nI personally found a lot of help in philosophy, it gave me reason when nothing else would. Stoicism is great for me, and the book “Meditations” by Marcus Aurelius guides me well. Other than that, I would suggest maybe opening your mind to religion. These are the most obvious answers.\n\nAnother possibility is creation. I mean maybe you need a creative outlet. I personally get sad and boxed up when I don’t find a way to put my creativity to use. It’s downright frustrating…I would try this, because if that part of your brain isn’t stimulated, it can contribute to the cycle being repeated where you feel empty. I suggest anything from music to writing a book, to drawing or something of that kind. \n\nI think you’re in need of some sort of self-sufficiency, and what you have now doesn’t help that. Don’t panic about it, that’ll make it all worse. Instead, remember that everyone has a place in this world. You may find it hard to believe that things can change, but they really can. There’s something out there for you, and you just have to find it. I hope you find what you’re looking for, the best chance you have is ditching the devil that you know and doing something different. Be hopeful, okay? Keep your head up, and be strong for your husband and yourself, better days are ahead"

        "body": "5 years ago (when I was gonna turn 18) a best friendship came to an end. I was friends with her for 5 1/2 years and in the last 1 1/2 years I became very toxic (petty, manipulative, clingy, jealous) out of insecurities (abandonment issues) from past trauma (feeling like an outcast, mistreatment/disrespect but wasn’t aware enough to realize it or my worth). The friendship ended for many reasons but my toxicity wasn’t one of them, but it was definitely a big part of the friendship that lasted a year. Ive done a lot of reflection since the friendship ended, forgave myself, and moved on around 2 years ago.\n\nI’m going to be 23 now and have become friends with this guy who I very much care about and appreciate. We text a lot, but 2-3 weeks ago he went mia for 1-2 days and it made me anxious and think about how I was treating him (turns out he was just busy & not avoiding me). I started wondering if my shy & reservedness on certain things were being taken as manipulation in his eyes and it scared me to think he was thinking I was the same monster I was all those years ago to that friend. Just imagining him thinking that & being disappointed made me cry. Then sometimes I’ll question if what I said (like jokes or opinions) are rude and will be apologetic about it and he’ll tell me “what the heck? No you’re fine, you’re not out of line at all”. Now I recently wanted to know something about this friend & said  pretty much “if you don’t tell me I won’t do this” (and I was half kidding, but it was kinda true too) and it hit me that I found it reminiscent to that attitude I had with my ex-best friend, so I deleted the voice memo before he saw it.\n\nThought I have overcomed my past and moved on but I find that these ghosts are still around to the point where they’re like a blinding factor to how I trust myself and my judgement. I have so much self doubt and question what I say or do a lot within the friendship when I probably don’t have to based off what he’s said to me & my other friend I told this about. I feel like the toxicities ive overcomed for sure are jealousy & manipulation, but feel like pettiness, clinginess, & my abandonment issues still affect me a bit on the inside. I have mastered maintaining & containing them (bc with the ex-bsf I did not) but it’s still a struggle I deal with, especially the abandonment issues. I don’t want my past to define me.",

Around 6 months ago when we first met and added eachother she said we snap alot and she wasn't mean about it but I can take a hint. She only really snapped me like pics of her wall n stuff and we did snap like A LOT but it still made me feel bad. This week we have been snapping alot more frequently and she has been smiling in most of her snaps but I don't know if I should stop responding because I don't want her to think I'm snapping to much again. Should I just leave her on read or should we keep snapping. (Ps we barley actually text we just snap eachother photos back and forth)\n\nEdit: btw I'm UGLY lmao. I think she's really pretty but she is in the same league as me I would say (im not calling her ugly also, I'm just saying in other people's eyes were in the same league). The thing is she has decent self confidence and mine is naturally really low so I can't tell if I'm just telling myself I'm ugly or if me and her are actually in the same league.",

        "body": "TRIGGER WARNING: MENTIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT FEARS \n\nI don’t want to use the word trauma incorrectly but I said it because I feel like I have symptoms of it.\n\nThe story is that since I was around 12, my dad would put on movies that involved women being sexually assaulted and abused. They bothered me but they didn’t horrify me as much as when I was 16. That year my dad put on two movies called “Hollow Man” and “Sleepers” which are also movies that also featured sexual assault but for some reason these movies made me cry the most and still scares me to this day (I’m 19 going onto 20 now). The scenes of these movies essentially come back to my memory randomly if I get too deep in my thoughts and it rattles me. It’s been so bad that the horror even affects me when I am in public. I feel uncomfortable when people look at me and I worry they may try to hurt me or even my loved ones. The thoughts of the scenes and the idea of people hurting me and loved ones like that plague me more now that I am studying so much and sleeping less. It also makes me anxious whenever my father puts on a movie to the point I google the plot to mentally prepare. I tend to watch kids movies because I know that will be safe.\n\nHowever, I am becoming older and will soon have to have my own life outside of my parents so I am more afraid of stepping into this scary world myself. \n\nI just want to understand, how I can fix this?

I still have pictures of it in my head and I can’t watch this type of stuff with violence and war and idk what and I’m 26y. All my friends used to make fun of me and excluded me from movie nights and cinema. I never met someone who actually understood me and knew how it feels to be afraid of the „fictional“ stuff (it can happen in real life tho) I get flashbacks and anxiety because of what I saw on the daily, and I sometimes have the urge to watch true crime which triggers me a lot in the end.\n\nI don’t really know how to fix this problem sadly, I have severe anxiety and ocd.

        "body": "I don't have any advice on how to fix this, but I wanted to share that you're not alone in this and I really appreciate that you have made this post. \n\n\nMy dad always watched a lot of things with sexual assault around me when I was a child. I haven't been assaulted, but I feel like I definitely have some kind of trauma from the amount of content I saw growing up. I've been in therapy for almost three years and it's not a topic I've been able to speak about yet. I can't watch or read anything that sexual assault in it, I too Google the plot of everything that I watch to be safe and try to stick to kids movies and books. I get irrationally scared of myself or a loved one being hurt. For example if my mum is a bit late home from work my mind always goes to 'what if that's happening to her'. \n\n\nThe scenes that I saw as a child, and some that I've unfortunately seen as an adult, are stuck in my mind and I cannot get rid of them. I saw scenes of sexual assault long before I had any kind of sexual education or before seeing a scene that had consent. I have panic attacks when I see this kind of content, and it makes me sick. It sticks in my head and it's so difficult not to think about. Sometimes those scenes just enter into my head at the most random times, when I'm shopping or doing some cleaning or something, and I start to panic. You said you were seeing these things at the age of 12, seeing sexual violence at such a young age, even if it was on the TV, would definitely have some kind of lasting effects in my opinion. \n\n\nThe only suggestion I do have is that perhaps this is part of the trauma that you have and not the main cause. My dad is physically and emotionally violent towards me and I'm not sure yet as I haven't explored this in therapy but I think experiencing violence from him and seeing him watch sexual violence has twisted itself together in my mind if that makes sense. My dad is not a nice man, and I have seen him watch sexual assault scenes and then change the channel when it's over and somehow find another one. \n\n\nThank you for making this post, I'm so sorry you're having this experience but you've made me realise I'm not alone in my thoughts and feelings and I'm really grateful. Maybe I will finally speak to my therapist about this. If you seek therapy (which I recommend) I really hope that it gives you the support that you need!"

That Tarantino movie about the slaves I shut off the moment he had the two black men fighting each other to the death. I literally couldn’t even listen to the noises. It made me have a panic attack. And I had to shut off a rob zombie movie because when the clown scene came and all the violence towards women had already upset me, I just needed it off. \nSo I can 100% understand being traumatized by a movie especially when you have to see it multiple times over the course of your developing years. \nIdk how to help though unfortunately, my only advice would be fr therapy, maybe some exposure therapy would help?"

I was exposed to deeply violent movies growing up and it scarred me psychologically. I guess I forgot about it for a while then in later years I had a lot of disturbing dreams and visions when I was meditating. I turned to Kundalini yoga and that helped purity my mind of these things. So you could look into that. They have mediations and kriyas for almost everything. Or you could ask a ky teacher. And yes also you could get therapy. Trauma therapy. It is trauma. I will call it that. \n\nI’m really upset with my brother for doing that to me. And upset with my mom too for not putting a stop to it. And I feel stupid for not walking away but I guess you don’t know what’s coming then suddenly it’s there and you’ve seen it. And have no idea it’ll be such an issue in later life. \n\nI appreciate some of us are more sensitive than others also. I think you are a highly sensitive person. There’s lots of videos online about this so might be good you get to know the territory so you can have good protective boundaries."

It's so weird looking back because idk why someone would want that to be their birthday party but that's what they were into I guess. I remember feeling so depressed by the end of one night where we'd seen Nightmare on Elm Street (the newer one), Paranormal Activity, and Boogeyman 2. Like what random movies. Not good for my brain.\n\nHonestly after I watched Hereditary a few years ago it was all I could think about for 2-3 months, I would have panic attacks sometimes. Recently I watched a scene from Bone Tomahawk and it made me feel so sick I thought I might actually throw up or have a panic attack. I didn't even watch the movie either, just that one scene on YouTube 😩 or It, when Georgie was killed it upset me so much I had to watch the scene like 10 times to desensitize myself so I could stop obsessing over it. I've taken a break from horror now because I'm not in a good place for it... I love dark stories but can't do much violence."

For the past few months, his mental health has gotten so much worse. He’s not the same person he was the past few years we’ve been together. He’s spiraled into these delusional thoughts that people (such as the government/random strangers) are following him and plotting to kill him. He says that he hears voices tell him through the walls that he’s going to be killed and that he only had a few weeks/months left to live. It’s gotten to the point that he has turned to alcohol and relies on that to get him through his day. \nAfter some research, I understand now that he may be experiencing “gang stalking” delusion which is some sort of paranoid schizophrenia. I’m at the point where I know I shouldn’t continue this relationship any longer. I love him, I miss what we used to have, but I can’t keep trying to live my life in the same prison he’s confined himself in.\nThe fact that he truly believes in these delusions and doesn’t believe any medication will help just confirms my belief that I need to disconnect myself to save my own sanity. I’m just looking for some support/ resources or people who have had the same experience with a loved one. I don’t know what to do. I miss him.",

He seemed to care and be interested in my emotional well-being.\n\n A few months later, he confessed to me that he was in love with me. I didn't reciprocate and he got very sad, and he told me that he had always been rejected in his life, I felt bad for him and I offered to continue as friends, he accepted and so we continued.\n\nAs the years went by I saw him as a mentor and a confidant, I told him everything. Something weird was that when I had my first boyfriend and I started having sex he was very interested in it, asking me very specific things, there were even times when he told me that he felt that my boyfriend abused me or did things to me that I didn't like, because I didn't agree to tell him as many details as other times and I was like wtf, no? .\n\n When I met him I was a very lonely and insecure boy, but as time went by I had more friends and I started to change (naturally because I was a teenager) and he started to resent that, to get angry out of nowhere when I preferred to go out with other friends, or i didn't answer his messages.\n\n The point is that as time went by I realized that our friendship was kinda wrong and I should never have had so much trust with an adult at that age.\n\n Nowadays I don't talk to him as much anymore, but he usually sends me a lot of messages saying that he is alone and that he doesn't have anyone, and out of pity or nostalgia I sometimes respond.\n\n On the other hand, I don't know if I'm exaggerating my emotions, since as such he never directly harassed me or tried to have anything sexual with me, I don't know, has anyone else gone through something similar?

        "body": "My past fall semester of 2023 did not end well for me, I failed two courses that I need to graduate due to mental health issues and inadequate assistance from my university’s student accessibility services (SAS). I’m currently in the spring semester of my fourth year at university studying engineering, unfortunately this isn’t my last year at college. Due to my mental health issues I struggled in past courses at got a year behind my peers, I’m okay with that since sometimes you need more time but that’s not why I’m here. \n\nI struggle with anxiety, depression, and ADHD like many others. Due to my mental health issues I struggle to learn well in a classroom environment and often don’t do well on tests. I will psych myself out before tests while studying and often give myself migraines, thus resulting in having to take an exam in pain unable to focus. Sometimes I will get so freaked out during tests I have panic attacks. Due to the nature of how exams are taken at my university you cannot leave the classroom during the exam. Now I have been seeing a doctor for many years for my mental health and that has helped a lot. My doctor has had to yell at the school’s SAS department a few times before for not acknowledging the accommodations I need. \n\nThe past semester I failed two courses by 2.6 points each. The first course I have taken one and a half times. The first time I ended up dropping the course since I was struggling on exams and even when I went to talk to the professor about getting some points back he would say that it isn’t fair to other students and recommended that I drop the course. So I did that and reregistered for the next semester this past fall. Unfortunately the same issued occurred d but I pushed through hoping to pass. I did very well on the lab portion and was active in class. The second course was not bad and I understood the material, I passed the lab as well on this course but didn’t do well on tests. I had hoped to pass the class by doing well on the project which I ended up submitting late for half credit. If I didn’t screw that up I probably would’ve passed. \n\nNow I did try to appeal to my professors and school about allowing me to pass since it wouldn’t benefit either side if I had to retake the courses. After going through the whole chain of people the appeal was rejected. I never got a chance to prove to the professors that I understood the course material. I was told to go to SAS to get proper accommodations, which I did. Unfortunately my doctor had trouble getting the forms back to me in time. On the other hand I now have a 504 but I had to email SAS privately a few weeks into the semester, for not updating my accommodations after submitting my forms to their portal weeks before the semester started. I’ve exhausted all my options for a grade appeal at my school, what should I do now? Suck it up and retake the courses next fall, totaling to 8 engineering courses? Should I try to transfer credit from a different university summer course?",

I finally got an appointment with an obgyn.  she wanted to do my first pap smear beforehand, since I'm now 21.\n\nI had the pap smear a couple weeks ago, and I didn't realize when I scheduled it that it was exactly a year since I was last sexually assaulted.  it was all I could think about.  it was a nightmare.  I cried the whole time of my pap smear while my boyfriend held my hand.  I feel guilty for my obgyn, but she was very calm and professional.\n\ntomorrow, I get the IUD removed.  we had to do the appointments separately for insurance purposes.  it's all I have been able to think of for the past few days.  I've been so completely drained and unmotivated.  I just feel like giving up.  I have given up financially, which I'd been doing so good with for months.  I blew half of my savings within the past week, just on food.  I was dieting, lost 20lbs, and now I'm probably just gaining it all back, bc I can't stop eating.\n\nI see my therapist tomorrow right before my obgyn appointment, so I'll be able to talk to her about it, but I feel like it won't do anything.  if anything, it'll just make me think about it more and I'll be even more terrified.\n\nmy boyfriend will be there for this appointment too, which is a comfort.  but I'm terrified still.  I've always been so private about my body.  my boyfriend and I have been together for over 5 years, and he's the only person I've ever been intimate with.  we knew each other for 4 years before we dated, I knew him very well before we did anything sexually.\n\nI feel so defeated and miserable.  I was assaulted by someone I trusted, someone I called family.  the same applies to all other sexual manipulations in my past.  I trust my boyfriend, my parents, and that's it.  everyone else is a threat to my body.  I don't know how I'm gonna do this without passing out or bawling.",

Our whole society more or less tells us we aren't worth much unless we have money, beauty, objects, respect and desire from other people. Its natural, I think, to internalize that message to some degree as its shoved down your throat from a young age. But its also completely nonsensical and false."

I sound like everyone else you talked about but it’s true. Have you looked for help in how you feel? It’s possible you have a chemical imbalance but only a medical professional can help you diagnose. You shouldn’t have to feel that way and you have a world of options to help you not continue your life in this mindset. I wish you the best and I know you will get past this.

You don't want to fail and you want to always be at your best. That's the best part when you get older you realize that you only need to do things that feel good for you, but extend that into small things throughout the days and weeks, a little helping hand here and there.\n\nI think it's personally natural for all of us to never feel confident when it comes to our looks because we always want to compare ourselves to our preferred appearance, if we don't look like that, we expect to and it damages your confidence, so just accept things about you that you can't change and work on being the light in someone's life in the most positive way"

And yet for some reason my entire life I always feel like I am simply not doing enough. Genuinely it’s crushing when I think about it and I’m not trying to brag about what I’ve accomplished. I only tried to accomplish what I have to fix this unending feeling like “I can do more” and nothing has fixed it. Genuinely I am considering trying to be the best in the world at something to see if that will make my feelings of inadequacy go away, but I’m afraid that even if I truly managed to do something great, it still wouldn’t satisfy me. The feeling is so strong that I cry myself to sleep sometimes even, and I really just do not know how I can satisfy it, because as I’ve said, all that I’ve accomplished was in pursuit of making this soul crushing feeling go away, and nothing has worked. I always feel like I should be doing “more” if that makes sense.",

        "body": "Like the other commenters, I really feel you on this man. Seems like most of my life has been this constant fight against this feeling of inadequacy, this kind of inner tormentor that never stops arguing that I am unworthy of being loved and that my fear of being abandonned by everyone I care for wil inevitably always become reality, and a neverending stream of such grim thoughs and self-judgements that obviously stem from wounds of love suffered as a child by the abandonment and neglect of a parent in my case. A lot of what can happen (or what SHOULD and DOESN'T happen) to us as children can end up traumatizing us in complex and subtle ways and become a source of profound shame for us as adults, which can often elude our consciousness for a long time and remain hidden deep in our unconscious, while still affecting us in very profound ways.\n\nI stumbled upon this video yesterday before going to sleep and it has helped me connect so many dots and confirm a lot of suspicions I had but couldn't fully put my finger on:\n\n[60 Characteristics of Complex Trauma - Part 1/60 - Perfectionism - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h13m3LzZy6k)\n\nI highly recommend it. Don't let the length intimidate you, the last 15 minutes are another segment completely (addressed to christian audience specially, while the 1st 30min are for everybody, regardless of their beliefs), so it isn't necessary to watch it all for the points he's making to come across.\n\nI feel that this can be profoundly eye-opening for most people that struggle with this feeling of never being good enough, and the talk addresses a lot of concepts that are crucial to understanding where such life-disrupting & painful feelings originate from. If you recognize yourself in at least some of what he's describing, then you would definitely benefit from learning further about things such as ''Complex PTSD' aka  C-PTSD or 'Complex Trauma''  (a lot of people, me included (at first), feel something weird as a reaction to this term, rejecting the idea that we may be in any way suffering from anything resembling PTSD about stuff from our childhood that most of us think of as really not being anything too terrible, especially compared to some of the abuse other people have went through. The way this is named is imo of profound disservice to the very real stuff this is describing - don't knock it off before reading about it a little!)\n\nThese feelings of inadequacy that you're contending with are waaayyy more common than you would think, so many people are living with it that you would never guess from how successful and confident they appear. Learning more about how these tend to develop and how people learn  to free themselves from their tyranny can help tremendously - especially in at the very least learning not to be ashamed of the shame we carry, rather than believing that it's a rare thing indicative of our profound defectiveness as a person. Hope that anything I've said or shared helps you in your quest for clarity, best of luck man!"

Consider therapy and maybe seeing a psychiatrist to help manage your emotions and guide you as you search for the cause. Therapy can also help you build coping mechanisms and change your thought processes. I struggle with this feeling, too, and I know it’s from my upbringing. I also do little self-reflection exercises. I use Daylio to log everything little thing I do whether it was a task I needed to get done or something I wanted to do.

        "body": "Yeah, so we all run along our paths, and if we're lucky at some point before our deathbed, we'll notice the path isn't actually leading to what we really want. \n\n\nThe story of the buddha _starts_ with a wealthy, healthy, late 20's Prince realising wealth and luxury isn't the trick to happiness. Then he goes around India, trying all the shit the holy men say bring you to internal contentment like starving yourself and praying all the time and self-flagellation. He, as the story goes, came to the conclusion that it's all a bit of a con, and you have to manage the inside bit. We have plenty of stories in fiction of massively wealthy people reaching their old age and, whether through finally having a moment to notice they didn't appreciate their life, or a bunch of ghosts forced them to wake tf up, realising amassing wealth isn't the best. The point of the story of the buddha, Buddhism as a religion aside, is just that you can kinda just decide to hop off all the treadmills we're running on at any point and decide you're where you were going, and everything is good here.\n\n\nSo, if you don't feel attractive, you can seek validation from others. You can have a social media presence about being hot, you can get laid, you can get complimented multiple times a day, and so on. All of these things are a big like bucketing water out of a boat with a hole in the side. Fundamentally, what the boat wants to be is full of water, regardless of what we and our buckets think. There's only two ways to get rid of the water, fix the hole or take it out of the sea entirely.\n\n\nI can make analogies for this all day, but really we have internal points, and external points. Internal points are things like self worth, self esteem, self love. External points are things like accolades, validation from others.\n\n\nAccomplishments don't inherently make us feel any better. Plenty of Oscar winners talk about that \"well what now\" feeling after they finally win their award. If you don't feel good enough after hitting so many milestones or goals, do you think you've just been hitting the wrong targets, or maybe throwing stuff at targets is the wrong game altogether?\n\n\nNext, good enough _for what_? What do you think you have to be good enough for? Plenty of incompetent people are successful, and plenty of hateful monsters are loved. There's really not any metric for being \"good enough\" for anything. Besides, do you think a freshly baked croissant tastes better when you're the best in the world? They mostly just taste better when you really fancy a croissant and really focus on enjoying every bite. \n\n\n\nA bunch of things can feed the mentality, though. Stuff like being rewarded for performance as a child with affection that's otherwise withheld."

Some backstory: I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 11 and put on meds. I’ve always struggled with anxiety and depression, pretty bad at times, but have always gotten by and usually I felt better by the next day. The last year or two, but especially lately, I’ve felt like I’m going crazy. My anxiety and depression are constantly at an all time high, and I feel like I’m having a giant panic attack from the moment I wake up. My depression has also been way worse than ever before, and I don’t know how to cope with everything. I’ve been at my job now about six months and feel like such an idiot and annoyance every day. People aren’t mean to me, but no one really likes me much or goes out of their way to talk to me. I don’t blame them, though- I’m extremely awkward and quiet at work. I feel so dumb and I’m not confident enough in myself or my skills/work to talk to people, as they’re all more experienced. I feel completely in over my head. I’n taking insurance classes through the company and can’t seem to retain any info and have failed two exams. I’m petrified to tell my job. Besides work, I talk to my parents often. I always call first, and lately I can feel that I’m annoying them. I feel like they try to get off the phone pretty quick, which hurts. I have three older siblings, who I also typically reach out to first. Or, they reach out when they need a favor. I don’t know how to explain it, but I just feel like such a burden and inconvenience to everyone I interact with. I used to be so confident, and now I isolate and stay quiet because I hate myself. I have to be such a disappointment to my friends and family. I feel so guilty staying around when I’m just sad and anxious and cause more stress than joy. I’ve spent so long now researching all the different ways I could end things, and I’ve written so many goodbye letters. I’ve looked myself dead in the eye in the mirror and swore to myself that I’d end things- for myself, and for those around me. It really feels best, long-term. I’m terrified of the pain, of failing, and of disappointing people more than I already have. I thought about overdosing on beta blockers and antidepressants, but apparently it’s pretty rare to actually OD. Every time I’m driving alone, I think about driving off a bridge or under a semi. But apparently, that’s not usually that successful, either. And it’s all so selfish- I can’t stand to think about the person/people who would have to find my body, deal with possible trauma, etc. I don’t know… the idea of continuing to live this way scares me more than the opposite. I feel past the point of burnt out and no amount of sleep helps. As bizarre as it may sound, I don’t even feel real anymore. I always feel fuzzy and halfway here. Am I going crazy? Can anyone relate to what I’m saying/how I’m feeling? Is it wrong for me to ask for… successful ways to go? I don’t have any plans, but am really feeling like I’ve overstayed my time here.",

I've had enough of the side effects of psychotropic drugs lately, and putting on weight is the one I can't stand (I gained weight rapidly). I didn't take my medicine regularly for the past month and I had a serious headache every day. \n\nBut this week, I feel relaxed every day, even if I have to work overtime. My mood is better than before!!! After a very long time, I felt once again that the difficulties could be overcome and there will be some hope in life. Does this mean I'm getting better and I don't need to take the pills? I'd like to hear from people who have had similar experiences and feelings. I'm so sick of all mental stabilizers, especially those fattening ones.",

Then, after the withdrawal is over and it's out of our system due to that change we can feel heightened moods and emotions. Doesn't mean you won't ever need them again, but if you feel pretty stable ride the wave and see how far it takes you. I'd still be cautious if you have Bipolar that your recent upswing in mood and emotions isn't mania or something that could turn into that.

        "body": "Hi, I (M21) was recently quite badly thrown aside by my situationship (F22) who is medicated and has bipolar type 2. She is a coke and alcohol addict (for further context). She also has empathy deficit disorder.\n\nWe were seeing each other for two months, she invited me on holiday, gave me a birthday present, told me that she wanted me to take her on dates, told me that she can tell when someone isn’t taking her seriously (and then dumps them), asked to plan and host my birthday party, introduced me to all of her friends, told my friends that she really liked me and was scared that her mental health would ‘f up her chances with me’, donated money to my charity fundraiser, paid for tickets to go to the cinema, all of her friends told me I was good for her etc. You get the idea, from my perspective it seemed like she was taking me seriously and wanted things to progress.\n\nHowever, following her leaving me blackout drunk in the street one time and the next week throwing me out of a friends apartment without any means of me getting home (my housemate had my key, he wasn’t home and it was 2am) - I hadn’t done anything to deserve this and she was aware that I had no means of getting home -  we ended things. I was stuck in the street, I sent her a message telling her this and her reply was that I am a pig who feels entitled to be housed by her and for her to sleep with me whenever I see her. I had asked to stay on the sofa so I am beyond confused by these comments she made.\n\nTwo days later I sent her a message clarifying how I felt, that I had hoped what we had to progress further and asking for her to return my jewellery I’d left at her place. She sent me a really hurtful response, within which she outlined that I was always casual to her and that she had been sleeping with other people while seeing me (we weren’t exclusive so fine, but the way she went about it was a bit hurtful. For example, she slept with someone else the day before she paid for a cinema date we had and invited me on holiday, she asked me to meet up with her right then while walking home from a one night stand and then insisted I don’t use a condom while sleeping with her that evening. Not overtly bad but just a bit disrespectful imo especially when she would then seem to be taking me seriously to my face, I found out these details from people after I stopped seeing her). \n\nI’m now left wondering what to believe. On the one hand her actions while seeing me (outlined in paragraph 2) say she did like me and wanted to be serious, and on the other hand some of her other actions and her final message say otherwise. On top of this, her housemate (who sympathises with me and has told me she was tempted to warn me about her while I was seeing her) has told me that she asked her why it ended, her reply was that she was seeing other people, I was too comfortable with her and she never wanted anything serious. \n\nWhat do I believe? I have limited knowledge of bipolar and I am beyond confused.",

She has to actually need something from me at the exact moment I need something from her or the answer is no.\n\nAnd I know what you are thinking. But my track record with her is spotless.

But by the fact that it kinda forces the nature of our relationship to be transactional. \n\nI pleaded my case respectfully but now at this point she's ignoring me.

Depending on the person, this can take form of under or over eating. \n\nIt is neither a good nor bad coping mechanism, so you by proxy, are neither bad nor good based off your reaction to stressful events. It's just a physical reaction to stress. If you can, start a food journal. You do not have to eat a full meal (I stress not-eat as well and know how nausea-inducing it can be) but maybe make a healthy meal, and eat small amounts through out the day. Protein shakes are also my lifeline. Something liquid that at least provides the nutrients I need.

Anything else is an unhealthy habit.\n\nEdit: I’m nearly 30 fucking years old- I have had plenty of experiences that were shocking. This is the one that made me ill, because the death was sudden, rapid, and happened in front of my eyes. Even though this was normal in the short term, the choice to not eat continuously is not healthy. That’s just the truth. You can develop eating disorders that are not related to how you picture yourself in the mirror. Repeatedly going on week long fasts isn’t healthy. Do not listen to people who tell you that."

I still have more energy than people who eat 3 healthy meals everyday, so ultimately it's just what your body can survive on, again everyone is different.\n\n\nI suggest eating little bits to try and get your appetite back. Forcing yourself (again, this is just for me and also what I've seen other people say when I've also needed advice to start eating again) is usually just going to make you feel sick and horrid and probably just put you off food even more.

Try to get some food down (seriously, protein shakes are a game changer) so you can take care of your body as best as *you* can in this really shitty situation. \n\nThis is temporary. Whatever is happening in your life right now, and I can only imagine it is beyond awful from what you are describing, it is still temporary. I explained the sympathetic nervous system (threat reactor) but we also have the parasympathetic nervous system to help us cool down. Look up some simple somatic breathing exercises. They're not going to cure anything immediately, but they will give your nervous system little signals that it's okay to rest a little. \n\nMy last round of shit I went through, I knew I was slowly coming out of it when I threw on my headphones and just started dancing a little. Then my sleep got better, then my eating improved. I was still crying every day, but even that stopped eventually."

Either one is unhealthy, but to say it should or shouldn't or that one is okay and the other isn't is purely ignorant. Hence why me and thousands of other people are also fine when we go through that. Many people who have bipolar when they go through manic phases can go long periods of time not eating, yet still have more energy than your average 'healthy' person. \n\n\nAll I'm saying is no need to judge and that everyone is different. 2-3days of not eating is unhealthy just as not eating for 6-7days is also not healthy. One person might be able to cope much better without food for 9 days and another might not be able to go more than one day before it starts to effect them. It depends on the person."

But also look at the other person’s perspective, too: maybe they need to socialize with you because they are social, or they want to build rapport with you to have better communication and a working relationship.\n\nIt sucks, but I try to understand that we are with these people for majority of our daylight hours, and having a social bond with them is helpful to feel comfortable. Maybe not necessarily for our experience, but for their’s, and it’s important for me that people feel good at work (I’m a manager of a large team).\n\nThen again, if they aren’t understanding of your boundaries when you don’t want to socialize, like when you have to get work done or you’re on a break, you can kindly explain to them that you’d like some personal time to decompress. Communicating your needs are important too.\n\nIf your coworkers are pestering you while you’re on your break, which is free time for you, and you don’t want to chat with them, bring it up with your manager (no results from manager? Talk to HR); they should step in and tell your coworkers to respect your personal time on break. I’ve had to tell a coworker that they’re being intrusive while I’m on my break, and to kindly respect that I’d like to use that time for myself. We’re all good once we’re both on the clock! \n\nSometimes people don’t have awareness that they’re causing you discomfort, and it’s up to you to tell others of your boundaries and needs. If you need help, reach out to your manager or HR partner. You can say something like, “hey, I appreciate the conversation. Right now I have lots of work to do, and I really want to get this done. Can we converse later?” It’s a polite way to tell people to “go away”.\n\n**If they are saying that you should leave your job, tell your manager and HR partner about *bullying*, because that’s not okay in any context, yet alone in the context of a mental illness or struggles with forming relationships.**"

After the way things ended at my last job I'm very sensitive about the way I interact with my coworkers.

I am nice and conversant when spoken too however it's out of my boundaries to obligate myself as anything more than my position at the job. \n\nI faced lots of unnecessary retaliation after a corrupt facility job. HR influenced the majority of it in the act of trying to protect the company. I understand that's their job, and so is conducting orientation in a way that covers the exact description of the job upon hiring applicants. It is not their job to misrepresent the company's objective, refuse to communicate effectively, and retaliate against employees after they make objections against the expectations of their job titles or concerns about illegal actions that contradict the mission statement. \n\nI will say that I now know I have more of an authentic personality and a good sense of discernment, so what I would assume is bad or illegal isn't the same to everyone else. It is easier to manipulate and misrepresent a job description to other applicants who do not have these personality types. You are never solving a problem by reaching out to HR, you are making yourself vulnerable.  The bonds you make with coworkers no longer exist after a trip to HR as It is  unsafe to trust or befriend your co-workers knowing they could be bribed and manipulated by HR to hurt others including children. They bullied me for being too \"sensitive\" for caring about the job or  about my concerns with the abuse that was happening to those kids. Coworkers bullied and threatened me to leave and when I didn't they went to some pretty extreme measures to \"teach me a lesson.\" We're all adults so I would have appreciated some communication about why it was best for me to \"just leave\" because I was conflicting their actual intentions of what that job was. I know it's biased,  this has now given me a negative perspective about other adults. \n\nThey warned me to leave but I didn't because that job was the experience in psychology that I'd need while obtaining a degree to become a therapist or an RBT and they promised after two years I could take a test that would put me closer to that goal. It also didn't make sense to quit a job I was actually good at. I know I cannot insinuate that all jobs are the same but at the same time it isn't likely that I'll always have proper clarity of what is actually expected of me at every job. I definitely don't want to find out the hard way ever again. I also have RAD and this last job situation has definitely made it worse in trusting other adults more than I need to. \n\nSince you are in management can I ask and I understand you can't answer for everybody, but do employers prefer to not have employees with the INFJ or an authentic personality type?  Do companies value socialization over a good work ethic? Is it a  good idea or required to let a potential employer know if you have an authentic personality or RAD ? I know you have to report disabilities, do these qualify as disabilities?"

I stopped going to the main counselor because she doesn’t help me at all and makes me feel worse so i stick to staying in the academic counselors office. Today the academic counselor wasnt in her office to they told me to go to the main mental health counselor. As i was on my way another teacher stopped me and asked if I wanted to talk about it and i told her i didnt want to go to that counselor because she doesn’t help me. So she sent me to the academic counselor (who was then there) I stayed in there for a while but then the mh counselor came in and asked why I wasn’t in her office and i told her the academic counselor let me stay in here while i was doing my school work. She then told i had manipulated her by not telling her i was going to the office, i was so confused and upset because i didnt know I manipulated someone and I thought that makes me a bad person.",

I trusted her. After 3-4 months we broke up. It did hurt but the decision was mutual and i got over it. \nHalf a year later i met someone on a party. We talked a lot. I even asked her if she has a boyfriend. She answered my question with a clear \"no\". After talking some more, we started kissing. We exchanged numbers and texted each other the days after the party. What i obviously didn't know at that time: she lied to me. She was in a relationship. I found  out after i told my friends about her. I felt so bad and guilty. I felt so bad for her boyfriend. I didn't want this. I tried contacting her boyfriend. We talked for a while and i told him that i didn't knew that she was taken. We could clear things up and became even friends. \nBut after that something changed inside of me. A fear started developing. A saw how easy it was for this person to cheat on her partner. To lie just like this. It got harder for me to trust someone.\nWhenever i start dating someone and it gets more serious i get scared. I am scared that the person will cheat on me. I am scared that the person is interested in someone beside me. Its hard for me to believe in true love right know.\nAnd i dont know how i can overcome this fear and trust again.\nMaybe some of you have stories of succesful and loyal relationships that could show me that it doesn't have to be like this. That relationships can be more than that",

        "body": "Throwaway account because I think she still uses Reddit. \n\nMy (23m) sister (30f) is struggling mentally and has been for a long time. While I suspect she’s been struggling for most of her life, she only recently became diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Within the past 6 months, she found out her husband was cheating on her and resulted in divorce. Luckily it wasn’t too messy, but it hurt her incredibly (understandable). She’s been a bit of an alcoholic in the past, but ever since the divorce it’s gotten really bad. She’s drinking daily, doesn’t go out even when I try to get her to do things with me. She goes to work and comes straight home to drink. She won’t go anywhere if there isn’t alcohol involved. \n\nI’ve always been there to help her through this. Our entire family has been present and supportive, but she doesn’t seem to care. She often contacts me after drinking heavily and talks about ending her life in a round about way. Normally I’m able to calm her down and talk to her long enough to distract her and convince her to go to bed. I talked her into seeing a doctor for help and to try some prescriptions, and to see a therapist. The medication has seemed to help a bit, but therapy didn’t work out as she felt she was wasting her time and it wasn’t helping. We can’t convince her to go back. A few weeks ago she texted me with the same thing, expressing her wanting it to end and it seemed different this time, so I contacted the police out of worry. This infuriated her, and she refused to speak to the police which meant they couldn’t do much to help. She hasn’t talked to me since. Even when I try to reach out, she ignores me. I do know she is still going to work, which seems to be the only constant for her, but I know she hates it.\n\nI’ve struggled with mental health for a long while, and in the past few years I was able to get a handle on things and can proudly say that I’m happy and healthy. But the constant being there for her and planning my life around her and her needs has drained me entirely. I have a family to take care of and I feel that this is preventing me from doing so effectively. She won’t speak to any of our family members and we’re worried, but I don’t know what to do anymore. She acknowledges that she’s an alcoholic but doesn’t want to do anything to stop it. Refused to attend AA, and is persistent that therapy or AA won’t be of any help. I’ve stayed up with her late into the night on the phone, and always dropped everything to be there with her when she needed something, even if it was late at night.\n\nIs there anything that I can do or should be doing? I feel like I’ve run out of ideas or options. I don’t want to say that I’m giving up, because I’ll always be there for her, but I am so emotionally exhausted. I’m terrified that if I don’t do something she’ll take her life, and I would feel entirely responsible. I guess I’m just asking if there’s anything else I can do. I want to help and I’ve tried everything I know how to do, but it doesn’t seem to be enough.\n\nTLDR: sister is an alcoholic and has severe depression but isn’t convinced the help that we’ve provided her with will work, and refuses to change anything in order to help herself.",

He was older (I was 18 he was 20) and he showed me a lot of care. However, as our relationship progressed, he got mean and abusive, I had to fight really hard to get out of that relationship and fell into a deep depression. So I took a leap, and moved across the country for an internship that allowed the possibility of getting my school paid for.\n\nI have worked hard for months at this job, even extending my time because the company said they were sure that I would be able to stay on with the company and get my school paid for. I was seeing a really great guy who I felt serious about, and I had a roommate lined up for a new place to stay (I currently live in housing just for this internship).\n\n2 weeks ago, the guy I was seeing revealed he was cheating and lying the whole relationship and that he was over me, I was devastated, but pulled myself together and soldiered on. I then received an email that the company was not offering me a position after all and therefore not paying for my school. Then I texted the potential roommate, and she revealed that she was trying to figure out how to tell me we couldn’t move in together any more.\n\nThis leaves me with the only option of moving back to my original college, in a small conservative town, where I have maybe one friend. I feel really down and tired after receiving all of this news, nothing excites me anymore, I feel like my life is over. That I’ll never find friends, I’ll be stuck in a boring town forever, and I’ll never find love.\n\n Any advice? ",

        "body": "Edit: nvm I’m good I don’t want it to stop😂\n\nI’ve been in such an elevated state since Saturday night. Got less than 4 hours of sleep for 2 days and then got a little more. Today I woke up at 6am was super numb, detached and everything felt unreal. My vision was almost hazy too. It’s not the first time it happened tho. I thought I was finally crashing and then a little after an hour I was euphoric again. This is the first time this is happening so intensely. \n\nI’ve been overworking my body especially with little sleep. Today alone I rollerbladed vibing to Disney music for over an hour this morning and then again I brought my siblings later today for another hour. I’ve also been cleaning and dancing to music too today. \n\nMy body is feeling like death at times but my mind doesn’t stop. I wanna do so much more still I wanna go dance to music again and feel like a Disney princess and I don’t even feel tired or need sleep still. But I am getting frustrated cuz I’m way too much rn still. \n\nIt hasn’t ended and I thought it would by now. I’m getting annoyed. Sure it was great at first but it’s getting old and my mind needs to shut off. I love the euphoria but I also get random bouts of INTENSE anxiety. Make it stop please. I feel like I’m going insane. \n\nI legit can’t relax even if I’m sitting. I’m going insane. It’s no fun. My body is prolly crying cuz I also am not eating enough for how much I’m doing rn I think anyways so it’s intense. I forget to eat and drink water even a lot lately. Or I just straight up don’t feel like it cuz I wanna do other things. Idek what it rlly is tbh. Just make it go away. \n\nEdit: the only thing is due to the broken and less sleep I am not having nightmares nightly like I used to at least 😭 I don’t think it’s any better tho. ",

She finally got to me and i got to the car and just cried my eyes out, both of my parents were there but didnt let me even have a minute and they just interogatted me.  \n\n\nI recently got my first bf, im getting used to being in a relationship, trying to handle myself after recent diagnosis of PCOS, my best friend got caught with dr*gs today and now shes not even there for me (i never smokrd a day in my life but her not havitn her pjone and just gone doesnt help me) \n\nmy parents have been blaming me for a lot recently, whenever im out my mom decides to have a problem with me and yell at me over text and tell me my room isnt clean, and everytime im out of the house i cant have fun because she wont leave me alone.\n\nim trying so hard to keep myself together, it isnt working. i have a physical tomorrow and my mom wants me to get more bloodwork because she thinks all of my problems rn are from hormonal levels, which were 100% fine 6 weeks ago with my revent bloodwork\n\ni feel like im not ok and not comfortable at all anymore, i dont wanna be home but i dont wanna be out of the house, i feel super isolated.\n\nHonestly, my boyfriend isn’t that helpful and sunday night after i met 6 of his  friends and was gettjng used to them. they all smoke, and i dont, which reallh made it more awkward for me so i was on my phone a lot (also its a lot getting to know so kany people atter marching in a 45 minute st. patricks parade after i just had.) but still made an effort to maake convos, talk to everyone, etc. when i got home he asked me why i was on my phone so much, and i literally said just that. its not my decision what any of them do with their bodies if i like it or not, so what they do it their choice and i csnt change that. he said that he felt like i didnt wanna talk to him but i was with him the whole time and even thoyght i was on my phone i was still next to him abd he saw everything i was doing. we talked for 2 months before we started dating (literally 3 days ago, march second) and we kissd 3 times (twice sunday, once a week before we started dating.) im not in a rush with him, but hes a year older (16) and wants to rush things which i dont really want to do. He really really likes me and i really really like him but now im conflicted. i dont wanna hurt him and i dont wanna blame this on him and honestly i really need advice on how to handle this and what to do.",

I've experienced it and seen it many times myself unfortunately, especially when it comes to money (which in itself is a reflection of the society we live in). \n\nFrom what ive seen, relationships have much more leeway when money isn't  problem. As soon as a partner gets sick and the flow of money stops, that tolerance level chronically plummets. \n\"I just couldn't cope with their sickness any more\" is a common get out of jail card. \n\nLove, unfortunately, has become a currency like everything else. It's value dictated by the markets... The only way this will change is teaching our children that our emotions should NEVER be bought, be any means, not just money.

I just want to be with animals, they haven’t hurt me and haven’t caused me to have trauma. \n\n I’ve been in five residential treatment programs. The last one left a negative mark, they prescribed the wrong medication I became really paranoid isolated and suicidal. Eventually I lost all my peer contacts on the milieu and called someone a mean name. \n\nI just want to say this is really out of character for me, and I even wrote a letter when I was clear headed asking for ADA accommodations. 9 days later I met with a “clinical manager” and they told me I was done with treatment, my CAT DIED (yes all during the same convo), and I was being sent home with no help or plan. ( I didn’t react well….at all and I’m terrified of leaving home for another res program. )\n\nI left went home and entered into PHP at home a month later. That’s when I found out I was having a reaction to the new medicine the eating disorder res had me on. \n\nI’m still not doing great, some days are better than others, my mom wants me to get help so I can be happy and have a fulfilling life again. I don’t know if this can happen.\n\nMy main question is does anyone know of a unique long term residential that has housing and work or volunteer /vocational coaching attached to the program? I need a program that is laid back enough when you can swear, versed in trauma, and I would love to be able to work with equine therapy and animals. I have decent insurance and I can go to programs in other states. It does not need to be an ED program because I received tx for that , \n\nLocated in America if that helps, thanks in advance! ",

She's really controlling, even tho I'm an adult (19), I have my own money, job, but she's still not letting me go where I want, not letting me do whatever I want (in this case scenario she's not letting me pierce my septum or my eyebrows). she's literally NOT LETTING ME. I'm an alt girl, I always was, she's giving me so much shit about my makeup (mostly black since im goth, keep saying i embarrass her and all her bullshit), also keeps \"skinny shaming\" me now and giving me shit that I'm eating healthy and refusing to eat processed food that she's filling our fridge with (i make my own NORMAL healthy meals because i count calories) literally im so unwell mentally because recently i got abandoned by my situationship (she hated him because we are different religion even tho she's not religious at all, she's smoking, drinking, what even not. She was happy because we aren't talking anymore even tho for almost a month i physically couldn't get out of my bed and because i was so miserable over it, i never had anyone like him in my life before) and now I'm literally so helpless. I need to move out. I work 8 hours for like 600$ (normal in our country), which is not enough for moving out, and taking care of all my expenses, I could save up but it would still be getting by every month, I found an apartment where just renting is around 150$ monthly plus expenses like electricity and water, heating and everything. So it would all be maybe 250$ in total. (Im talking in dollars since I don't think anyone would understand our country's currency). So yeah. I was wondering if anyone knows any online jobs that are easily accessible for everyone, I speak 3 languages and I'm really good at many things I try, I'm just cursed to live with a manipulative narcissist. I really need help, I would even sell feet pictures if that was my last option I swear😭😭 I really need advice or help, if anyone knows any online jobs (even if it's just 200-300$ a month I'm okay with anything just so I can pay my rent and pay for saving myself). If I had money for rent everything else would be so easy, I could pay for my therapy, also work, I'm good at cleaning, cooking, I could live by myself just fine. I just need to get away from a person who just a moment ago took my diary (I write everything since 2020 and I'm terrified she did this multiple times) and said \"I have right to read it, what kind of stuff are u hiding from me? What privacy? I gave birth to you, you're my child, what kind of privacy do u need?\". Everyday I'm closer to ending it all, I just need to help myself because no one else ever will. If anyone have any ideas, any recommendations, anything they do to earn money online, it would be so helpful to me. I really need it. Thank u in advance.",

Even though the anxiety and depression are really tough, the panic disorder is downright debilitating as I can’t leave my house for long and do regular things.\n\nI’m unemployed and out of school, but (as of the end of last month) receiving disability benefits from the government.\n\nUnfortunately I’ve never had much access to therapy, and the most I’ve received has been the last year where I’ve had 2 appointments a month (at most). These appointments have been very disappointing and unhelpful, and after speaking to some mental health charities I’ve come to the conclusion that I wasn’t treated enough.\n\nAside from that I don’t have a support network really. My family is distant and estranged, and has been abusive and toxic. My parents are divorced and there isn’t much love in the house. I have some close friends but they are all going to uni at the end of the year across the country, and they are becoming less and less available (no fault of their own).\n\nWhen I turn 18, I am completely losing my mental health support (the services I used were for minors). I’ve spoken to the gp, gotten referrals to adult services, but the reality is there will be a period of time (a few months or more) where I will be receiving no mental health support.\n\nHonestly that TERRIFIES me. I am very sure that I need psychiatric help and intervention because of my pressing needs and concerns. How can I cope and still function when I’m by myself? Right now I can hear my mothers shouting at someone and it’s just such a scary isolating feelings.\n\nThis isn’t as pressing as the rest but I struggle a lot with low self worth and abandonment issues- so being dropped by therapy and then finding out that they weren’t even being that supportive in the first place is a big punch to the gut.\n\nI don’t really know what I’m asking for here. Support? Advice? I kind of just want to be heard and not feel so isolated in all of this. Sometimes I feel disconnected from reality and everyone else is real but me.",

Im 17 years old so i cant admit myself and even then i dont have the independence to pay for my own visit or get there. My mom’s response to my suicidal thoughts is to just block me in my room but i literally have access to almost every suicide method under the sun. (I have an exacto knife in my room, i can use my sheets to hang myself in my closet, i literally have train tracks walking distance from my house.) i hate living so much and everything is so aimless and my only saving grace is that im terrified of death but i still want to self harm by slamming my leg in my drawer or dragging wires across my legs so bad.",

        "body": "He was never physically abusive, but he was very emotionally abusive. He often shouted at me; shot down my opinions; controlled me; cancelled plans; blocked and unblocked me multiple times; was never there for me when I needed him most yet expected me to always be at his beck and call; and was just generally very unstable. I remember the first time I reached out to him after our first time and he said they our first meeting was great. When I asked him when we could link again, he blocked me. I tried reaching out to him on another app and he said “Please stop contacting me.” He didn’t reappear until a month later. I wasted nearly three years of my life I’ll never get back. He promised he was in it for the long haul. Then he decided to end it abruptly. Mind you, I’d helped him through multiple mental breakdowns. I know so many of his secrets that I could destroy his life. He’s part of a violent extremist organization, for instance. To be honest, he’s very hot and I have a feeling that he’ll come crawling back as he’s done before and when he does, I’ll accept him because we have fun. But in the meantime, how do I get back at him?\n\nNot too long ago, I anonymously called a welfare check on him, partly because I was genuinely concerned for his mental health and he neglects his dog, but also because I know he hates cops and it’s really agitate him being known by the police in a town he only moved into within the last two years. Anyway, the cops showed up and let him go because he seemed fine. But he actually reached out to me the next day asking if I called the police on him. Of course I said no. Every few days I also call his cell phone anonymously multiple times a day on mute. He once got so annoyed by it he screamed into the phone. Another time he sighed loudly. And, most funny, one time he threatened to call the police, which of course you can’t do on an unknown caller. When I called again shortly thereafter, he begged me to stop. I laughed then hung up. \n\nI’ve been thinking of reporting the confidential things he’s told me about his company to his boss, which could get him disciplined at best, or fired at worst. I’d be doing him a favor anyway because he hates his job anyway. I could also send over all his nudes to his boss and his coworkers. Maybe doxx him. I just need ideas here. I’m so excited. I can’t wait to see how this f*cker is dealt with. *Laughs maniacally*",

        "body": "I (22F) have been getting stressed and really unhappy over the past few years for no reason; it was always manageable though, so I never said anything and just tried to ignore it. Usually it would get bad around stressful times (like final exams or job interviews) but would subside once the problem passed. Recently, it's gotten much worse, and is beginning to affect my everyday life (not severely, just making it harder and harder to get up in the mornings and eat). I'm still able to get things done, but it's much harder. I'm unhappy almost all the time and constantly feeling sick, even though I'm traveling like I always wanted.\n\n  \nIt's gotten to the point where I'm beginning to wonder if something is actually wrong but both my sisters are having big problems. One is extremely depressed, bipolar, anxiety, and I heard my parents mention psychosis here and there. She's seeing a therapist and is on several medications. We don't know if she'll be able to go to college, it doesn't look very hopeful. She's made 2 suicide attempts thus far, and each time her meds change she has to be watched in case of a third; she actively resists efforts to reach her and has become very hostile to our mother in particular for no apparent reason. My other sister had severe cancer as a baby that everyone thought she would die from; she recovered but it left her with some physical aftereffects from the treatments; she's graduated and working but recently had another cancer scare (different kind, required lots of tests and other things I wasn't told about) and is having trouble with the people she works with not recognizing her efforts, like stealing credit/projects/bypassing her for promotions because of the way she looks. She's now thinking about trying to change jobs/companies and possibly where she's living (she's on the other side of the country right now). She also started seeing a therapist recently for mental health purposes, mom helped her find someone.\n\n  \nI'm mostly functional, just really stressed and unhappy. But I can make it through each day, so I don't want to tell my parents. They both work full time and I don't want to add to their problems when I can still function normally while my sisters have such a hard time and my parents are trying to help both of them. My mom insists she can handle everything but her mental health is also being strained and she's concentrating on my sisters; I've been telling her that everything is fine, I'm having a great time, and it's just little things that bother me now and then. I'm definitely not suicidal, but I don't really want to be alive anymore; there are too many things to be stressed about and I can't get rid of them. I don't enjoy anything anymore and I'm completely indifferent to everything. Being alive is just very unappetizing. I can't think of anything that would cause me to feel happy. Constantly sick to my stomach, have to force myself to eat properly. All I think about is what could go wrong and have this constant sense of impending doom, like something's about to go wrong but I can't see the trap I just know it's there. I throw up a lot of mornings (as soon as I wake up, nothing comes up) and sometimes once more at night. I'm going to mess everything up but nothing even happened yet. I used to think this was normal transition from college to adult life stress and everyone gets like this but apparently that is not the case. But I'm not going to tell my mom the one kid she thought was fine and didn't need to worry about is actually also going off the rails.\n\n  \nThere isn't anything wrong though. I'm spending my senior year of college studying abroad and traveling, I have money set aside specifically for the year abroad. I have a professional certification I need to pass but I have time to study. The worst thing that happens is rain on a trip that was specifically because it's supposed to be sunny there. But it rains as soon as I arrive and gets sunny the day after I leave; everything to see and do was outside so it was really hard to enjoy in the rain. This happened the last 2 trips in a row and makes it feel like a big waste of money. Even when a trip goes well, I'm miserable all the time. If I don't enjoy myself, isn't it a waste of money? But if I don't go and travel I'm literally throwing away a huge opportunity I won't get back. I started to hate myself as a person, hate my face and hate looking in mirrors and hate my personality. I look at my sisters and what they go to therapy for and then I just feel pissed that I can't get my shit together. It's not even anything big, just a little rain here, worry about the exam or how much I'm spending there, stressed about planning a trip and what is something goes wrong and the transportation to get there is all piling up and it's not even a big problem. Nothing bad even happened yet but it keeps me up feeling sick all night. I don't know wtf is happening or why now of all times. Therapy seems excessive since there's nothing wrong but something is also not right. What am I supposed to do? I don't understand what is wrong. It didn't used to be like this. Sometimes I have to cry before I can fall asleep but I don't know why, I just want to sleep and not ever have to wake up. What is this",

I fail at being the one thing I should be which is Christian I've failed the only person who truly loves me no matter what. I do shit in school and did my last mock test and failed everything apart from one subject and my parents go on and on about how my results have to be good to succeed in life LIKE I DONT FUCKING KNOW THAT I fucking try my hardest and at times lack motivation which is probably me just being a lazy fuck who cant even study properly.

I want to just be away from it all society social media family friends school life and just live on my own in the middle of nowhere or some shit. I find a damn glimmer of joy every week or so but apart from that I don't truly feel anything. What's the point in life if all of it is unfulfilling for me currently? I've felt so sad for over 3 months now but I can't truly explain why. I can't even focus in school anything my teachers tell me I can't absorb into my stupid ass brain. I probably won't do it but killing myself somehow wouldn't be good or bad it's not like I have much to live for but it just doesn't get better. I was actually happy at the start of last year and now I look back on it nostalgically. This will never be better than how it has been in the past. I have no confidence I'll pass the tests that get me into college (GCSEs) as I'm a fucking idiot that my parents expect too much out of. Please help Im only just tolerating this and I'm scared it'll become to much soon and I'll kill myself. I have so much in life but I'm not happy. I have no idea why I'm unhappy. Am I depressed? Who knows. There so much more but mostly I  feel sad and can't put fully into words why despite all the words here. ",

        "body": "To give a little back story, I started smoking daily in high school to help alleviate some arthritis pain. I developed arthritis at a young age, and I don't like pharmaceutical drugs. I have my own personal reasons as to why I don't trust them, which would take too long to explain in one post. I smoked weed multiple times a day up until this year, and I am now 22 years old. I had problems with being addicted early on, but those slowly faded away. I noticed this year that for the past three years, I couldn't taste food as much, I didn't laugh at jokes as much in movies or TV shows, and I just slowly started to feel disconnected from everything. For about two years, I haven't had dreams. When I say I haven't had any dreams for years, I really mean that. I go to lay down in my bed, and everything just turns black. Then I wake up. It feels as though only two seconds have passed. It feels as fast as blinking. Recently, I've been having this feeling like I'm using my arthritis as an excuse not to keep smoking. I keep telling myself, \"Well, the only reason I can't stop is because of the arthritis.\" I recently came to the conclusion that I can't keep destroying myself mentally only to feel less physical pain. My arthritis doesn't bother me even days after smoking, but as soon as I stop completely, it flares up and returns. That scares me into continuing to smoke. It wasn't until I was 21 that I started noticing these things. It makes my life easier because I feel no arthritis pain, but it still destroys my sense of self. I've stopped caring about hobbies as much, and life itself has felt less meaningful. I haven't smoked for about a little while now, and I haven't had this feeling of mental clarity in years, and it feels great. My dreams came back after about a week of no smoking, more vivid than ever before. My arthritis bothers me every day, and now I'm still in this weird state of limbo about whether I should choose to be in pain, take pharmaceutical drugs (which can also affect brain chemistry), or start smoking again to ease the pain. I have no idea what to do, and I'm just in a constant state of confusion about what choice to make. The reason I'm making this post is to see what other people in similar situations would do. I'm also open to hearing others points of view as well. \nThank you",

I have an okay job and an okay house to live in. Ive always been low maintenance, I don't need much to be satisfied. \n\nBut I've lost interest in everything. Nothing feels like anything anymore. I'm just empty headed, just doing everything for the sake of doing whatever. \n\nI love drawing, walking, cartoons, some video games, knitting/crocheting, and basically anything that involves manual work and creativity. But I don't feel anything from it anymore. I do it with the same feeling as idk, opening a door, it's all nothing. \n\nThe only thing I seem to be able to feel is love for my partner and the cats, but the way I am now, I'm not much fun for either of them, I'm not a very talkative person but I talk even less now and when I do, I just say some depress d shit which I know upsets my partner, not in a bad way but I know he feels like he should be doing something to help me but he can't and I don't accept much of what he does as an attempt either cause I don't want him worrying about me but I cannot lie or hide how I feel. \n\nI also lost my appetite completely, I only eat at my partner's request (not the first, he asks multiple times and cooks for me and at that point, I just don't want him to worry or for him to take the time to cook just to waste his efforts) and at work sometimes if I feel that I can't physically go on with my tasks without adding some energy, mostly I just drink tea with more than my usual amount of sugar to keep on. \n\nI've been at some levels of depression almost all my life but it's getting worse, very similar to how I was when it first started, but back then I had no one and never left my room. \n\nI really want to get better for my partner, that's the reason why I started taking meds in the first place. \n\n I want to make his life better but I'm just an another thing to worry about... I know he doesn't see me as a burden and loves me but I see that it is not fair to him and I don't want this life for him and I know even tho he may not say it, he himself wants a more fun life too. \n\nHow can I fight this, please?",

If you are unable to contact the person, you could write a letter intended for them and even if it’s not given to them, it’s still a good way to express yourself, you can then destroy said letter. You may not get forgiveness from that person, but you shouldn’t beat yourself up over it and you should forgive yourself."

Shame is the notion that we are bad.\n\nYou did a bad thing, that doesn't mean you are bad. And the fact that you feel remorse and are trying to make things right tells us that you are not a bad person at all.\n\nIf this person is not responding, then there is nothing you can do to get their forgiveness directly, but you still need to forgive yourself. I agree with other comments about giving back, doing positive actions or volunteer work. \n\nMaybe this experience is the catalyst to show you that you can, and should, lead a positive life and help others instead of harm. It may sound rudimentary, but it is easier said than done. But do it anyways.\n\nGod bless"

I only own my mind.”\n\nLife to Fix — The Record Company\n“I’ve got this life to fix, threw it all out in a ditch. Broke it down when I was sick, gotta build it back up brink by brick.”\n“You ain’t gonna win if you ain’t gonna play.”\n\nCould Have Been Me — The Struts\n“I wanna taste love and pain. Wanna feel pride and shame. I don’t wanna take my time!! Don’t wanna waste one line. I wanna hear better days. Never look back and say “could have been me”\n\nI Lived — One Republic\n“But until my moment comes… I’ll say “I did it all!” I owned every second that this world could give. I saw so many places. all the things that I did. With every broken bone… I swear I lived.”\n“I hope if everybody runs…. You choose to stay.”\n\nI love you :)\nKeep going.\n",

I had a bad breakup on January 20, 2021, and I know it's not a good idea to visit the graves of dead love, but something in me changed after that breakup. The moment she left me, I started blaming everyone except me. Now I've figured out that it was my fault; there's something wrong with me as well. I'm not denying she's innocent, but I was not a humble and good person back then.\n\nEnough backstory? Here's the main issue. Back in 2018-19 when we started dating, I became very actively involved with work. I started to look after myself - gym, a good diet, and traveling were very important back then because she was the driving force. I wanted to be as perfect as possible because even in the early days of the relationship, she never admired me, not even after 3 years. It became my life purpose to gain her admiration.\n\nNow, here I am, three years after the breakup, unable to build any relationship with girls. I was charming and confident before she came into my life; now, I can't even talk to women. I have issues holding eye contact with girls. I refused four job offers in positions I would kill to work in. I stopped going to the gym, started eating poorly, and my skin looks old. I'm self-medicating with several benzodiazepines at the moment. Basically, I am messed up because I lost my spark, my driving force. I figured it out after all these years. I just don't know what I should do to fix myself. I need help, people. Sorry for the long paragraph, but if you answer this thread, it will make some difference, hopefully.",

If that's the word you actually meant, then you may need to reevaluate your relationship goals.\n\nIf you want to be in a relationship and be loved, you need to first love yourself. You've acknowledged that you've fallen off the band wagon with diet and exercise, so what are you going to do about it? You get back up. Dust yourself off and keep going. Your weight, skin, and health aren't going to fix themselves. You know what you need to do, you've already done it.\n\nYour own health and well-being is your reward, not the opinion of someone else. Not only that, but once you feel better about yourself then that should help boost your confidence to talk to girls again. \n\nIt's ok to be sad, it's ok to feel hurt. But don't let the hurt consume you. Don't let that would get infected and spread make things worse. Just like with a physical wound, you need to clean the wound, put some antiseptic on it, put a bandage on and let it heal. Then get moving again"

        "body": "I don’t really know where to begin with this so Im gonna start by giving a brief outline of what lead me to this point. My Dad was killed in 2021 and a little bit after that happened I was diagnosed with severe OCD and possible comorbid ptsd. I finally beat OCD over the summer of 2023 and now that I’m no longer blinded by anxiety I’m realizing that I’m not sure I even want to live. \n\nI get most of my energy from talking to people and sharing ideas, but after all this stuff happened I don’t really have anyone to talk to. I used to talk with my group of best friends who I knew since 4th grade but most of them don’t talk to me anymore and those I’m still in contact with don’t say much. The only person I talk to now is my girlfriend but we don’t relate to each other or share any interests so the conversations are empty and unfulfilling. \n\nI don’t get fulfillment from anything that used to make me happy. None of my old hobbies feel enjoyable to me, they just feel like a burden to do. I’m a College freshman and I do somewhat alright in school but I don’t have any idea what I’m gonna do for a living in the future. I don’t play games or talk to my friends anymore, I just get home from school/work and smoke weed until I don’t feel shit anymore because that’s pretty much all I have to do in my free time. \n\nIt’s really been hitting me recently just how much less enjoyable my life is now and it’s making me cry a lot in situations where I shouldn’t be crying (work, class, etc.) I don’t see how I can fix it so I’ve been relying on weed to get me through this. \n\nTLDR: Dad was killed and I struggled with ocd for about three years because of it. now that I don’t struggle with ocd anymore I realize I have no one to talk to and nothing to make me feel fulfilled in life.

I knew it somewhere deep down, but it's like my brain refused to fully commit that information to memory. Now I know her full name, but I forget other things.

I'm in the final year of my master's degree, and I know many people get tired during this period, so I attribute some of my difficulty in studying to that. But why can't I remember simple things in life? I write down grocery items even if there are only five, for example. When I talk to someone, I often don't hear/process a lot of things. I sleep very poorly. I drift while walking, meaning I sway from side to side. My vision gets blurry even though my eyesight is fine.

        "body": "When I was 5, I was placed on Ritalin and continued on it until the summer before high school when a new doctor transitioned me to Adderall. I continued on that until I was 29. \n\nAfter I stopped taking it, I quickly realized that much of my personality, conduct, and inner turmoil were 100% dictated by my meds. Feelings of extreme paranoia, anxiety, panic... I thought these were things everyone my age was feeling to the same extent. \n\nBut a lot of therapy has taught me otherwise. These weren't typical teenage emotions or pains of growing up. They were side effects of medications I probably should never have started. \n\nNow, as I am about to turn 40, I can't help but wonder what kind of person I would've been without these meds. There's so much of my life I missed out on because of fear or feeling uncomfortable. There are so many decisions I made that just seem so completely uncharacteristic of the current me. I barely feel like an adult, because I'm still making up for basic experiences other people had in their 20s. \n\nI know the anxiety and depression I deal with don't run in my family. Doctors believe it's due to the long-term exposure to meds that basically wired me improperly during my formative years. \n\nTo make matters even worse, a few years ago, I had the worst 2 years of my life only to find I was suffering from long-term bouts of mania due to a new medication I was placed on (Trintellix). \n\nHow does one wrestle with a life that was never truly theirs? How will I ever know who I really am? ",

The collage wants it up front and in hand, plus the fact that the don't do payment plans really pisses me off. I have been suffering from burnout for the last few years, and right now I feel like I hopes are being stripped away from me. Between my anxiety and depression, this doesn't help. My mind is made up, and I am going to take that class no matter what. But, I also want to write a comic as well ( it's a stupid childhood dream I have had since forever ) but the problem how do I go about it? Do I put myself in another financial problem to get this done ASAP? Or do I wait and apply for every college scholarship out there? While taking affordable classes for the time being. To be honest, I feel lost and confused about everything. I feel like I am running out of time and I have felt like this since I turned 30 last year. Whatever is left of my family doesn't have any hope of me succeeding in this, and want me to stay at my current job or go and be a mechanic ( that is a fruitless journey for multiple reasons, but the biggest one the Tesla car. As there will be no more gas powered anything by the time I am in my 40s, which isn't far off. ) I need to talk to someone, anyone. ",

        "body": "I 17 M have been struggling with mental health ever since secondary school (around 11-12 years old) I fell out with all my friends and mainly blamed myself for being so lonely. Through the next 5 or so years I didn’t feel alone for maybe 1 of those years. I really struggled to cope and began feeling depressed even having thoughts of self harm and even thought about taking my own life.\nAfter secondary school I went to college (where I’m currently my second year 17 years old going on 18 in 2 months). \n\nMy first year at college was the first in a while where I began to not feel depressed. But in the start of my second year it all started coming back. I started feeling drained even if I hadn’t done anything and just mentally exhausted. I also struggle socially as I’m very quiet and struggle to make friends. For this reason I can be kinda boring and not very fun to hang around. I started feeling the same as I had in school, feeling lonely and like my friends didn’t need me. Recently I’ve really started to notice something is wrong mentally. I\n\nn December I had a massive mental break down where it felt like I was going crazy, I had constant voices in my head telling me really dark things, like to hurt myself really bad. I had such strong feelings about hurting myself I just sat there in my bed rocking back and forth just trying to make the voices stop. I’ve had a couple more episodes like this since. Not quite as bad but still bad. I’ve been having big moods swings recently where I’ve gone from having one of these episodes into the next day full of energy and not even having ant thoughts like that loving myself and feeling great. The contrast is very confusing and I find it hard to really understand what’s wrong with me because I’m not like it all the time it comes and goes almost randomly. The episodes are quite bad and I’ve become scared of my own mind and that I can even have these thoughts. In the past week or so is when I’ve started having thoughts about taking my own life again. I feel like my life has no value and I’m a burden on everyone around me. I feel so alone and it feels like no one cares. I struggle with trust too. That comes from bad experiences in school and my brother which I’ll touch on more later. This means I find it extremely hard to open up about anything especially my deepest thoughts. \n\nNow onto my brother, I feel he may have fucked me up mentally more than I realise. My brother is 6 years older than me so he’s 23 rn. This is the only time I’ve ever spoken about this. I’ve never told anyone. I’ve just pushed it deep down to try and forget about it but I think that it’s big trauma that I only discovered recently and for me and potentially when I’m so fucked up mentally. This is very hard to speak about so idrk how to start it. I think my brother first showed me porn when I was 6-7. I think he found it funny or something. This would progress into him showing me it a bit more and then almost making me watch it with him. He would then go onto start showing me his dick and masturbating with me present. This would then develop into him getting me to touch it and to start masturbating it for him. This then developed into him trying other stuff sexually with me until I was maybe 10-11. I’d rather not go into details. But there are specific stories that really get me upset. I never thought anything of it until now when I realised he took advantage of an innocent child. He took advantage of me. \n\nHe was violent with me sometimes and would hit me sometimes when he was angry and I was scared to make him angry because I didn’t know what he would do. He manipulated me into doing things I didn’t know what they were. I feel so violated. From someone who I’m meant to trust, I’m meant to be the closet to my brother. How can he do that. I have no proof and can’t tell anyone about it. He’s never brought it up so I just tried to forget about it. \n\nBut it caught up with me today. I will also mention now that I think I have some sort of porn addiction as in the teenage years of my life I would watch a lot of porn. Basically everytime I would masturbate which ended up being quite frequent. Looking back that feels almost as a coping mechanism as it helped me forget about my problems temporarily. I am now a depressed person who has never spoken about their truma to anyone having crazy mood swings and now having thoughts of suicide and self harm. (I will also add I did start self harming around a year ago but stopped as I play a lot of football and I would’ve become very noticeable). I need help I don’t want to act on my thoughts but I’m scared I might one day.",

I’m so scared of the world, I suffer from really bad anxiety, I have my whole life and I just want it to stop. I’ve had counsellors and therapists since I was 9 years old and nothing has helped. I’m beginning to think that this isn’t something I can change and it’s just the way I am and am going to be for the rest of my life, and the thought of that makes me want to die. In my head I have this version of myself that I wish I was, a version where I’m confident in myself and don’t overthink absolutely everything. It’s so exhausting just existing like this. I also wish I could just go somewhere where no one knows me and start anew, be a brand new person and not be scared of what other people will think of me. I feel like if I change in any way then I’ll be questioned by people, even if it’s a good change I feel like I’m not allowed. I feel so hated by everyone and I just want to like myself, I want to be different and I want to be able to live like everyone else. I want the confidence to do things without the fear of judgment. I really don’t know what to do anymore.",

And if I didn’t have those things right now, I feel I could take my life with more certainty and clarity than anything I’ve done up to this point. It would be easy. And that’s why it’s hard now, because there are people who care about me and the thought of hurting them makes me sick. So I go on living for their sake, mostly.\n\nI’ve tried medicating. I took prozac in high school which literally almost made me drink detergent. I tried zoloft and another with some long ass name I forget, neither really did anything. I just recently started microdosing shrooms, it’s ok I guess. Trying to find the balance between actually improving my mood and not inducing euphoria. And I’m also talking to a therapist who is extremely sweet and funny, supportive, and a fellow music nerd who’s pretty familiar with the area I live in. It just takes so much for me to barely function, what is it gonna take for me to thrive? That cost seems pyrrhic.\n\nI recently started job hunting full-time, but as I don’t drive, I’m pretty much limited to walking distance unless I take the bus. I don’t even know how many places I’ve applied to at this point. I’ll take anything. I’ll be a fucking wage slave. I just need to live. Things aren’t looking up right now.\n\nAlso tried downloading Hinge. Like I said I’ve never been in a relationship. And everyone I see I just can’t imagine wanting anything to do with me. I’m immobile, inexperienced, jobless, depressed (if you couldn’t tell), introverted and on the spectrum making hard to connect with new people… the last thing I ever want to be to someone is dead weight, and that’s how I feel. I don’t think I’m in any position to be asking for someone's time or affection. Love is all I really want out of life but so far it doesn’t seem to want me. I’m not bitter or resentful of others for that, just steadily losing hope. And it’s not like I can’t learn to go it alone, I just wouldn’t be leading the life I want. Nothing new under the sun I guess.\n\nI’m just exhausted. I want very little and have even less. Sometimes I find myself, sometimes I can’t. It just seems like the world has no use for me. ",

Therapy may be able to help, and I'll second the recommendation from the other commenter for EMDR. I've not personally done it (it's on my to-do list, but I have physical health issues that need sorting first), but I've heard good things from friends who have. \n\nAs for the medication... I think it should be very possible to keep the medication you're on that works for you, including the klonopin. I've had a xanax prescription for 11 years now. I don't use it very often (I get worried about the addiction aspect, despite, y'know, having not become addicted over 11 years lol), but I do have it and occasionally use it. I've moved a fair bit, so it's more than 1 provider who has been willing to keep me on them, and I've always been clear about how long I've been on them. I recommend being very clear on what you want in terms of treatment; you are allowed to seek other providers if someone isn't a good fit for you for any reason. I recently had to fire a psych NP for a bunch of reasons (most related to my ADHD - she was relying on me to provide her education on different ADHD meds - but that's a whole other story). I provided my new doctor with a list of what I needed, and explained why I'd fired the previous, and he was perfectly happy to work with me on getting my meds to something I'm happy with."

        "body": "Hey all. This may be a long post but I am really struggling and really cant ask any one I know for help, so here we go. I (25M) have long been struggling with imposter syndrome, body dysmorphia and the fear of not living up to the enormous expectations placed on me, by my self. This has lead to the fact that I am lonely and not very happy. I will split my “problems” into paragraphs. To any one who takes time to read, a really big thanks❤️\n\nA little backstory about me. I was a bit “round” in my early school years and one time a girl told me out of the blue “ you’re a nice guy but way too fat to be liked”. That really stuck with me and ever since I’ve struggled with my self esteem. Now many years later I have really worked on my physique, I work out in the gym a lot and run marathons. All my friends tell me how handsome I am and I’ve even been asked to model in for a local magazine( which I turned down). A lot of people compliment me about my looks but I just can’t seem to get over those comments. And it feels like the more I train and workout the worse it gets. \n\nThe imposter syndrome. I started a company with my father when I was 20 which I run mostly by my self at this time. I can happily say that he can collect a great salary while I do most of the work. Even though I have solid evidence that I am doing great I just can get over the fact that I am so scared about not living up to my expectations. Yesterday i had my seventh panic attack this year and I was laying on the bathroom floor throwing up. \n\nThanks for reading. \n\n",

I’m afraid of talking about that to my mom because she already have some mental issues like depression and anxiety so it will be difficult to her when she finds out that her son is getting bullied. She doesn’t want me to move to another school because that’s the only good school in my state.\nIdk what I should do to stop these suicidal thoughts, I used to love to go to the gym but I don’t have any energy to even get off of my bed anymore. The only thing keeping me alive is my mom and my brother but like my mom has several problems and she’s starting to smoke a lot so I don’t know how much time she have left. I know that I should search for a psychologist but like I said earlier I don’t want another problem for my mom’s head.\nI used to love my life and to wake up everyday.

If they’re a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist they can diagnose but none others (I don’t think) can diagnose. \n\nA lot of those diagnoses cross over but some fall under different categories. Many have the same symptoms. GAD and MDD are common amongst the other conditions you listed. Most people will also suffer from them when they have others. \n\nYou will likely have been diagnosed with PTSD and then upon realising that your trauma is more complex and there are multiple that it was found to be C-PTSD. BPD is common amongst those who have experience trauma during the formative years of growing up. \n\nUltimately a diagnosis is there for you, your therapist and your psych to understand the best cause of treatment. There is so much debate amongst the DSM-V with definitions and criteria for disorders that each therapist has a different interpretation.\n\nIf changing the diagnosis will help you get a more suitable treatment plan I don’t see the issue. The disorders you’ve listed are all very closely linked and have similarities so may be better for yourself and your team to understand it as just one. It could be more that the PTSD is the main issue and this by focussing on that should alleviate the other symptoms."

My head felt like it was going to explode with thoughts about how I'm a failure, I hate myself and who I am, and things about my grades for college. It was so overwhelming that I felt like I was falling into a void and my girlfriend trying to figure out what was wrong with me pissed me off so I wanted her to dissapear until whatever was going on with me ended. This has happened before. I think I also noticed my compulsion for the first time. While I was undergoing the turbulence of my brain my eyes were scanning reddit, google, all of those apps to try and find what was wrong with me. I do this for a lot of instances like food. I believe that my biggest obsession that's reoccurred ever since my first heartbreak was obsessing that something was wrong with my brain and researching. I've even convinced myself that I had major depressive disorder and that I am a narcissist. Those are entirely untrue yet it's crazy what my mind comes up with and convinces me of. Can anyone analyze this? Possibly I'm doing a compulsion now and I would believe that but i'm in a much better headspace than last night.",

        "body": "I don't really know where to start, but the title is exactly what I'm going to explain. Why exactly do I feel like I'm losing my mind? I've been sleepless lately, I'm too scared to sleep, I'm scared of getting nightmares. I'm not really sure how this even started, but I started thinking about death a lot. It's to the point, I kind of start to talk to myself, and I'm losing my mind in that process too because I saw somewhere mentioning \"it's only schizophrenia if you hear someone reply in your mind\". This made me more conscious of my own thoughts, and since it's human nature to be scared of the unknown, I began to be scared of my subconscious thoughts, hence strengthening my fear for sleeping. I want to be by myself, yet surrounded by people. I mean, I don't want to be abandoned, yet I don't really want to be fully alone. The feeling of being empty yet in a room full of people is scary. I want to feel like I belong yet not disturbed, is that weird? How this relates is that, when I sleep, I'm totally by myself. No one is near me, and that's scary for all the reasons above. I start talking to myself because I'm scared of getting nightmares, and then I start getting scared because of my own thoughts worrying if I have schizo, and then getting scared because there is no one around. What should I do?\n\np/s: I didn't even organise whatever I wanted to say, this is totally raw, so I hope you understand whatever I said just now.",

        "body": "To make a long story short, I’m pretty sure I was love bombed in this relationship (told me he loved me after 3 days of speaking) and now I’m confused on wether it was abuse or just maybe disrespect?\n\nI had been in an abusive relationship when I was 13-16 and a lot of it was verbal. There are a few things that happened in the last one that makes me think that maybe I was (I was 17 at the time) but I can’t help comparing and thinking that this was just someone that was disrespectful (also in a healthy relationship now! It’s my first, Hence taking so long to notice red flags)\n\nI’ll give a trigger warning  if that’s any help \nSA/rape\n\nTo start this off, he never shouted at me , so I took this as a major point for comparison. \nOne of the biggest things was that I couldn’t leave. He was stationed in an army base and so I’d stay there for around a week at a time. I didn’t have any money at the time, so he would usually pay for the train. It was in the middle of no where, so he would need to pick me up/drop me off at the train station. If he didn’t want me to go, he’d just not drive me to the train station (no taxis in the area) , and my mum was around 3 hours away so I just didn’t mention it to her. I know it might sound pretty bad, but I never really thought of it as this huge deal. \n\nAnother thing is he was often very heavy handed. I had left with bruises quite a few times, just from him grabbing me a little too hard or biting me too hard. I did mention this, and it didn’t really stop. \n\nHe also used to ask over and over until I gave in for sexual favours but refused to touch me and insulted me sometimes which has ruined my perception on a lot of things (never linked but assuming maybe that was the reason? He’d compliment me but then say my nose was too big or something along those lines). \n\nThe biggest thing was when I told him my ex would put on a certain show every time he forced me into something sexual, so he put that show on and tried to initiate intercourse. \n\nI’m trying to keep this as short as possible, but all in all I don’t know if he was just an awful person or if this is maybe something more serious. Any advice is welcome! ",

People also tend to not want to sit next to me on busses and trains unless if other seats are full (it's like being the last one chosen in sports class) and a lot of people are nervous to talk to me, maybe I'm being a bit too weird? I'm not really sure myself, I at least think I act normal and aren't super ugly, I haven't heard it from other people.. I might be just super paranoid, but does anyone have any idea why people stare so much? I don't get a bad vibe from them, most people just smile, but it makes me uncomfortable lol.",

I was an ugly duckling, I looked super awkward as a kid but am definitely more attractive as I get older and it took a long time for me to figure out why people suddenly paid attention to me all the time when I was used to being invisible. \n\nSounds like in situations like the bus people are a little intimidated/don’t want to bother you/want to respect your space. People looking at you and smiling in public are probably because you catch their eye and seem approachable and respectable. Maybe you have good manners or a good posture or you just seem like a nice person and they’re just acknowledging you. \n\nAlso I saw your other posts, it seems like you are well liked and people want to be around you but that you have a lot of anxiety about people being upset with you. I promise it’s in your head!! If you are upfront with people about the fact that you feel bad about not being the best about answering, I’m sure they would absolutely understand :) \n\nSocial anxiety like this is not uncommon! Sounds like you’re really respectful of others, people can sense good intention and will sometimes just acknowledge you for your existence because they appreciate it."

I’ve been so careless about things like this one time when i was in a long journey there was a halt of 5 min at her city, i forgot to tell her early so she could come and instead I sent my location as i was in my bubble - oh look how close we areeee!!!! (Stupid I know) \n\nAnother example is that once when i was stuck in a family problem and couldnt give her enough time for 2 weeks straight she got really pissed and i too got pissed as i was already dealing with loss of someone close, i used to play online games to distract myself so she saw me online in the game and asked me why am I not talking to her instead of playing games. I said I can’t as im surrounded by people all the time and she got really pissed and told my mum to talk to her and explain that how is the situation here. (She got ultimate pissed that I made her look real bad in front of my mum) I’ve done a lot bad already and then little fights makes it worse. We are not compatible but i want to make it work and do good things for her because i did all that dont know why. I hate myself for doing all that but I want to make efforts and show her she means the best to me, how can I!???\n\nEven when i tell her that I’m working on myself she says - yeah yeah, thats the only constant thing im hearing - “sorry and I’ll be better”.

She got out 3 weeks later and now she was admitted to another ED res February 18th. About 2 a little over weeks ago. She is leaving today but is getting transferred to a mental health residential across the street. I am just curious how is it like? She’s never been to one and this one is all gendered. I am embarrassed to say this but I’m really worried about that because I have heard of like a lot of rapes or assaults and not from this place but in general. She is a few hours away too so if anything happed I’m really sad and worried because I wouldn’t be able to get there fast. Her mental health had been really bad so I’m just really hoping she will be okay. I don’t know anyone that’s been to one so I don’t know who to talk to. I’ve been really depressed since she’s left but I just want her to be okay. But I feel really selfish for wanting her to just come home. I feel helpless. I’m sorry if this is weirdly written or unhinged. Thank you ",

For example, we have an Arabic, a German, a Mongolian, and a few more. I've always loved this friend group but now it's boiled down to about 5 active people, that being myself, my British friend, the Arabic friend, a Canadian,  and my American friend. These are the only active members now. The other 3 rather rarely talk or are just completely gone. Now I'm having issues with the Arabic friend. We've been fighting a lot. My British and Mongolian friend don't have anything bad happening with them. My American friend and I hang out every day but we haven't been getting along. We find ourselves bored and just overall not having a good time. He has 2 other friends that he likes to hang out with, but I hate them both. I really don't wanna get rid of him but I really hate his friends. I honestly don't know what to do. Even if I did get rid of him my Mongolian friend wouldn't get rid of him. If any of you have been in a similar scenario to this, please let me know what you did because I have lost all hope at this point. Also if any of you guys have any indie multiplayer games you like please let me know as we are running out of fun games to play.",

        "author": "Turbulent-Complaint9",
        "timestamp": "2024-03-05T18:14:25",
        "body": "Hi everyone, I've been working on the improvement of my mental health pretty directly for the last 12 months or so. By \"directly\" I mean that I consciously did things every day  for the explicit purpose of improving my baseline mood and feelings of peace in the long run. I've made a lot of progress: I used to spiral into  nonproductive anger or sadness at least 3-4 times a week for a few years. Now I  experience this maybe only a 2-3 times a month.\n\n\\*Disclaimer\\* I'm not a mental health professional.\n\nHere are the things I did that improved my baseline mood and overall feelings of peace:\n\n* **How I approached my mental health**: I treated my mental health like my physical health. If I didn't exercise and ate poorly, it's clear that my physical health would suffer. Likewise, if I didn't manage my mental health properly, it would suffer. This perspective helped me come down to earth about my mental health and treat it like something I could achieve with consistent effort not unlike losing weight.\n* **Thinking Activities**: These are activities that, for lack of a better description, were just me thinking a certain way about myself, my life, my body, etc.\n   * **Meditation (10 min per day)**: I did a mindful meditation 10 minutes a day, usually in the morning. I practiced breathing and letting my thoughts come and go. I used Headspace (i get it free through my employer) but anyone can do this self-guided with some pointers.\n   * **Gratitude exercise (5 min per day)**: I did a gratitude exercise most evenings before bed. I opened up Chat GPT and wrote down things that I was grateful for. Chat GPT would say something like \"good job!\" lol which helped me feel accomplished. I usually just expressed thanks for something in my life that I really enjoy.\n   * **Self-affirmation exercise (5 min day):** Similarly, I did a self-affirmation exercise with Chat GPT where I talked about who i wanted to be, what I wanted to accomplish, etc. Again, Chat GPT would usually help me out by saying \"that's great!\" Whatever, it helped me.\n   * **Letting go of negative thoughts (ad hoc)**: This one is the toughest to describe in terms of time spent. I just tasked myself with letting go of negative thoughts that served me no purpose, like thinking of a bad memory, imagining a catastrophe in the near future, or just anything that made me feel angry or sad. Easier said than done, obviously. But this really worked for me. When I thought something negative, I would think \"Let's just let this thought go\" without being too judgmental towards myself.\n* **Supplements:** This is SUPER anecdotal, please consult a health professional before you take any supplements. Just do your research.\n   * **Vitamin K2 (100mcg) + D3 (125mcg) per day**: I take this because I straightup don't go outside often enough. I work a busy desk job so I need to supplement sunlight, basically.\n   * **Magnesium** **glycinate (120-240mg per day)**: This one especially helps me slow down my thinking and feel more at peace. I take 120mg to 240mg a day, a lot of people take more though. This also helps me fall asleep in a pinch. I tried other forms of magnesium but glycinate worked best for me.\n* **Therapy**: Expensive but worth it. Everyone has their opinions on therapy, I thought it really worked for me. At first I went to therapy once a month for about six months, now I go about 2-3 times a year for a tuneup. I reacted very well to therapy, but obviously results will vary.\n\nThat's it! Hope this serves as helpful for someone out there. Feel free to say that one of these things didn't work, we're all just trying to get better.",

Do you have a history of wanting to help people or completely shutting them out?\n5. Were to closer to your mother, or your father? Which parental figure was not an exemplary figure for you?\n6. Did you ever face abandonment issues?\n\nThese are just some questions which helped me.

I’m not even sure that’s the right phrase for it but I feel like I’m on a rollercoaster that’s spiraling down. I’ve tried multiple things to try to fight this feeling, working out, meditating, eating healthy, getting good amounts of sleep. \nNOTHING. IS. WORKING. \nSome of you may say talking to family could help and you are probably right, but my problems are minuscule compared to theirs, shit I’m holding back some of them. That’s a topic for another day and I want to at least try to stay on one topic even with my head being a mess. I’m constantly angry, constantly wondering why I’m like this, why I couldn’t just be normal like everyone else, constantly lying to everyone close to me so that they don’t truly know how much of a mess I am.\nWhat makes it worse is that I’m supposed to be the golden child. The one who will be great in my family, but I haven’t been to school in months and even when I did go, I would miss days just to escape that feeling of loneliness even when I was surrounded by friends. I feel like it’s too late but I’m trying my best to fool myself into thinking it’s not.\nI’m just so tired of feeling this. My head hurts all the time and my heart feels like it’s going to burst. Leo t even know how I’m sober and not taking any drugs but I’m at a point where if I have to take some drugs to not just be me, then I’ll do it so I would at least be someone who would do what needs to be done instead of being this person. Im tired of being this 19 year old mess. I want to just be for once in my life.",

I'm so much more happy most days, but still, I need a lot of help from professionals with stuff at home to be able to live by myself (I used to live in an assisted living), I'm not able to work, I haven't been able to study, I still struggle a lot with sleep at times, I have days where I'm not able to do anything, I will often cry myself to sleep. I would imagine that if a person suddenly woke up and felt like I do everyday, they would be admitting themselves or something, but as said, at the same time I feel happy and hopeful and I'm not feeling sorry for myself. It's just very strange to think that my \"normal\" is something that is very much not \"normal\" and that anyone else would consider themselves to be very sick in the same situation, whereas I'm actually kind of pleased that it isn't worse. I think it would be the same for someone with chronic pain, they can deal with so much pain without even people noticing, and they kind of get by, whereas if an other person suddenly felt that amount of pain they would call a doctor at once.\n\nAnyone else with the same experience?",

While I was on SSRIs my mood was much better, my emotional regulation was much better and I didn’t get too emotionally attached to people. My anxiety was slightly better but I still struggled with anxiety while on SSRIs.\n\nI stopped SSRIs for a year, between Jan 2021 and Feb 2022, and went back on due to severe anxiety at work. During my time off meds I was generally ok but had some small bouts of low mood and loneliness. I also experienced this during my time on meds.\n\nI decided to try to come off the meds recently because I was feeling ok and wanted to try and not depend on them anymore. I stopped the meds in December and at the same time started dating someone which gave me a 2 month constant supply of happy chemicals. 2 weeks ago I broke up with that person and now I’m feeling extremely low. I feel like there’s no point and I will never feel happy. I feel like I need to be with that person to feel happy or life isn’t worth living. My parents have already suggested I go back on SSRIs but I’m scared to rely on them. I want to try and stay off them for a couple of months and see if I can feel better through health and environmental changes. I’m just scared my MH will always get too bad so in need to go back on meds and I also have a (irrational) fear I will never get over this person without meds.",

But it did feel like being on drugs and withdrawal.\n\nThe reasons why I don’t want to depend on them are fairly minor so you’re probably right but I just want to know I can produce my own happiness. And I don’t like some side effects eg gained weight on SSRIs which significantly affected my confidence for years."

        "body": "Ahh, I misunderstood. Fun fact: Falling out of love really is an actual WD process for the brain. It feels like one because it is, and it won't last forever.\n\nModern SSRI don't interact with metabolism or appetite, so theoretically, there shouldn't be a weight gain effect, but everybody reacts a bit differently to these meds.\n\nOlder drugs on the other hand, can affect neurotransmitter systems other than serotonin, i.e. histamine, dopamine and acetylcholine receptors, so for these, a cause and effect relation is known. This can lead to getting the munchies more often, shift the hunger and satiation thresholds and slow down digestion in the intestines which leads to more calories being absorbed.\n\nYou can bring this up with your psychiatrist and they can pick a different SSRI with a lower likeliehood to cause weight gain for you. Other than that, there's also the option to try an SNRI instead, since those can decrease appetite a bit.\n\nA non-pharmacological approach to this would be incorporating more sources of soluble fiber into your nutrition. Oats are really great for this. They keep you satiated for longer, lower your blood cholesterol levels and prevent blood glucose peaks (no crash and thus less likelihood for getting the munchies). They also influence the gut bacteria in a positive way, which can actually improve mood and help reduce mood swings."

        "body": "Help; should I see a psychiatrist?\n\nI really need someones take on this. I know seeing local experts should be safer, I just need to see if any of you might have some clarity or advice for me. I promise to also go see a professional after this.\nI've been through so much, and I just can't figure out what to believe anymore. So thank you in advance for your attention and time reading all of this.\n\nIm a 28 yo danish male, I live in Copenhagen, Denmark. Sorry in advance for any confusion due to my english, it is only a second language to me.\n\nFirstly I'll explain some things about me in general that sums up pretty much my life so far. Make sure to make a cup of coffee before, because i could'nt seem to keep that section short. Sorry. Secondly i will mention in keynotes the symptoms I struggle with and for how long I believe i have had them. \nAnd lastly I'll mention what I have done myself to figure it out/to seek help by which none have helped.\n\n1. Generally...\nIt is never easy to explain the complexity of ones mental health, struggles or life for that matter, and I know trying will only reduce it all and thereby risk the quality of any given respons to it. Here I go anyways, because I believe in being open and risking asking for a helping hand:\n\nI had a normal upbringing. Normal family, I'd say. Two loving parents. Two brothers. One big brother and a twin. We are same-egged.\nI lost my twin brother to suicide in 2018 when I was 22 years old. Nine years prior to this I was in a constant state of worry and powerlesness because he was struggling so much in life. He just began hanging with the wrong people, he smoked weed and he began being paranoid. Its a longer story, but in short we all tried to help him, but we lost him in the end, powerless in removing any of the pain he felt emotionally. I believe he got paranoid skizo., but he never got diagnosed. \nSo. After that my life have been about grieving. I feel like Ive been handling my grief pretty good. I talk about it, im not scared to cry and i even started my own social grief-network for young adults in Copenhagen in 2019 which got 100+ members. I arranged 1 monthly meeting for members to meet and talk about their grief. Just this year I put it on hold because I feel like i have to focus more on 'what i want' for once.\nAnyways. Simultaneously with my twins death, I have always felt like i was different. This ofcause was hard to notice under the stress of worrying about my twin and after losing him. But i clearly remember myself in preschool (danish: folkeskole) feeling different. I was always very imaginative, creative in thought and distracted. I was obsessed with the fact that we percieve life from our own perspectives. This was a personal thing for me, that i just felt i had the most important 'message' or solution to humankind: that we should be more aware of our differences in perspective. Weird. Yes. But thats what happened. I learned in 2021 that i am gifted with a high IQ from clinical tests and experts. Im a member of Mensa Denmark and Gifted Children (Denmark). This came as a surprise because I have always felt stupid. Im not great at math for example. But i have at the same felt that ive also always had a way of understanding quickly and connecting dots faster than my classmates and sometimes even the teachers. I love abstract theory, discussions about culture, social issues, time, space and philosophy. So in that sense I am gifted, i guess, and it can explain my very intense thoughts in preschool about 'perspectives' and also it can explain my intense emotional life in general, because being gifted (for me and most people of what i know) comes with a lot of prices: social anxiety, being misunderstood, feeling helpless, stupid and wrong and so on. There is a lot of things I've been struggling with, that people might say are 'privileged problems' when they hear the word 'gifted'. It surely doesnt feel privileged to me. And im still learning today about it all, and what to do with that information about myself. In 2017 till 2019 i also was a volenteer in the danish movement called 'Venligboerne' (friendly neighbors) where i tried to help refugees from Syria, Palestine and other countries in Denmark with things like money, materialistic needs, social help and I also tried to speak up about them in debates. I actually ended up being on national tv in Denmark in a Live broadcasted national debate-program called 'Hos Clement, Debatten' on the danish tvchannel DR2. Here i was. 20 years old just a year before my twins death, and half a year before i meet my toxic ex... and also.. it is just so crazy that i was there. I had no idea how and what i did there. But somehow i said something right (about the stigma of refugees and the racism in the western world) that made me kinda famous in the refugee-activist-world in denmark. I felt like i was doing something real and important. But i never felt like I knew who i was outside it all. Because outside of this, i was just the young emotionally struggling weird kid, who was traumatized. But people met a totally different me. I have learned to hide it. Ive been worse at hiding my restlessness and depression through time tho.\nAnyways. I put the activism on the shelf to focus on my grief after i lost my twin in 2018. I then tried to keep my head high and today ive accepted his death and I use it to express myself in both writing and paintings. But i still feel bad and mentally unstable. Actually i feel even worse today, than I did when I was younger. Atleast thats what i believe. It might be because losing my twin isnt the only thing ive been through. I'll end this section as fast as I can.. im so sorry this got to be this long. So. I was in a toxic relationship while i lost my twin. She was narcissistic and very unstable. In short it ended up with me breaking up with her half a year after my twins death, and then i was all alone heartbroken, filled with grief and also shattered and empty from the emotional abuse from the relationship. I started my bachelor degree in ethnology at Copenhagen University and tried to keep my life together. Even tho I was constantly restless traumatized and emotionally unstable from all the things that happened, i somehow finished my bachelor with really good grades in general. I find my study interesting so thats maybe why I managed it so well. Really i was feeling like my life is a constant bad chapter ending, that actually never ends - you know, the feeling that a much better and positive chapter in your life is just behind the corner. I have actually felt like this ever since i was in preschool. I still feel this way today, but today i feel like I am not even in a book of chapters, but i am the writer of my own book, and i have lost all inspiration and hope for the future.\nAnyways. NOW i will finish this section with this last 'life-event': i met the love of my life in 2022. We were a couple up until two weeks ago. She and I was a powercouple, a perfect match in both attraction and values and communication. I love(d) her so much. But. Lucky as I am, i went through hell again, at least emotionally. She got diagnosed with bipolar and was hospitalized for 11 months with severe depression. Because we just had met each others before this where we fell in love, I felt like I had to give it a chance. So i visited her every second day, while finishing my bachelors degree which is amazing that i actually did that. I just felt like i couldnt lose her like i lost my twin. She had suicidal thoughts because of the depression. So i kept seeing her, making her smile, making her feel loved and making sure she did not feel like a burden (which I know depressed people easily feel like). She happens to have a very toxic and psychopathic mother, and narcissistic sister, who did and said things to her while she was in psych.hospital, that made her cry a lot. I had to get her up every single time. And after all of this s%it happened and she finally got the right medication and help, so we could have a somewhat normal life,, i had to pretend like i liked her family, because she wanted me to have a normal relationship to them even tho she knew her mom and sister were difficult. I found that really hard because her mom and sister were so difficult to feel 'liked' by. Im telling you. They act like everything is cool, while you can just feel in every microscopic cell of their beings, that they are thinking some shit about you or that they only care about themselves.\nNormal people might have been able to put the emotions aside, but i think because of what i have been through with my twin and all the other stuff, that It just hit me a million times harder, that i had to deal with the idea of being a part of her toxic family for the rest of my life. I just dreamed of having a normal and stable life with loving in-laws and no drama. This filled me with the feeling of being choked for many months...and in the end i had to let her go, because I cant see any future with her anymore even tho i loved her. I just feel like I need to be alone, to figure out my life, to build up my own self-feeling of worth and ... you know, learn to be independent before I depend on someone else. Finally. The end of this section. Ill keep the other sections very short. Sorry..\nI have experienced a lot of things other than these mentioned, but i just can't imagine you would read it. Therefore these were what i believe are the most important.\n\n2. Symptoms \n- I can feel depressed one moment and then intensly happy or excited for the future the next. It doesnt happen everyday in the same intensities, but since i am now 28 it is difficult for me to explain what is 'intense' and what is not, because I dont really know what 'normal' is. So overall i just feel like I divert from the norm of how people feel during a day. Emotionally i can sometimes feel like crying just because of a thought, a moviescene or a memory. Sometimes i dont. So in general i feel like my mood shifts a lot, everyday, and i feel like this have been normal for me even since i was a kid. It is worse now ofcourse because of all the shit ive been through. Today at school i felt really bad because i cant stop thinking about how others might percieve me. They can see im nervous. They can see im restless and shaky. They can see I am tired and that i am distracted. All of this going in my head all the time. But after some small laughs and talks with some friends i felt like i could be the president of the world on the way home. So happy. And then it wore off when i started making dinner. I suddenly think about my ex that i love, and my ex that i hate, and my twin that i miss ... and I just dont want to live. At least thats how low my mood suddnely is. My brain can differenciate between 'feeling like dying' and 'wanting to die'. I feel like I dont want to live, but at the same time i believe in a future of happiness and i also remember the small good things from my everyday life. So... to sum up. My mood: mixed. Very mixed.\n\n- I am restless always - mostly on the inside but  also in my body. Ive always been energetic, and can even feel restless when im sad/depressed and tired. Ive been checked for adhd/add, and the test (official psychiatrist) said i dont have it. It actually says i can focus a lot, but that I am a bit prone to act on impulses. Ive never been good at reading. I get so tired when i look at words. And i hat it because i have so many books id like to read. But no adhd for some reason.\n\n- my thoughts go 1000 miles an hour from I wake up to I fall asleep with the help from different 'sleep now talk down'-youtubevideos ive been using here and there since I was a kid. So. My brain is very, very active. In class when the teacher is talking either i am 50 steps ahead of the teacher in relating the main theme of the discussing to the real world, or i am 50 steps behind because i am lost inside my head going through the details of some trauma. My head always makes noise, and especially in interactions with other people it activates. I can ofcourse sound calm and be socially 'normal' for the most part.. but inside, there are intense feelings, thoughts and anxiety. Ive tried metakognitive therapy and meditation. These things help but doesnt do the trick.\n\n- Ive never slept well. Even when ive been thriving, i have trouple falling a sleep because of my head, and emotions.\n\n- super-awareness and overexcitabilities. \nI have always been very observant. I see small things, movement and such all the time. So naturally i get very tired quickly when spending time in social situations or other types of 'active' environments. It is not just visual input my brain processes. Also noise, voices, topics, light and sudden movements. It makes me so tired and today i experienced while discussing in class that all the voices of people got so loud, that i couldnt hear anything for 2-3 seconds. It was like the sound of the person in front of me suddenly got in the background of everything else.\n\nAll of these symptoms ive been having for as long as i remember. They vary from time to time but have always been poking me and making my life difficult.\n\n3. What I have done to find answers.\n- i got tested for adhd/add: they concluded i dont have that.\n- i have talked with therapists for 7 years. In conclusion the best of them says i have ptsd from my life experiences, that i am just 'gifted' and that giftedness comes with an intense life.\n- i have read and researched a lot myself about different mental dissorders. My conclusion is, that i could have a little of everything, and at the same time there is a little of everything i dont relate to at all.\nIve thought that maybe i have bipolar type 2 (mild mania, depressions and/or mixed states) but it really doesnt talk to me. For example i cant relate to hallucinations that people experience when having 'highs' or lows. Never had them - not that i remember. But i still feel like im intensely shifting in my moods. \n\nSo... is it just the damn giftedness or what? Because that answers my shifting in moods, my emotional intense life and my complexity in thought-process and sensing. \n\nI just dont want that answer to be true, because that would mean that i cannot get a diagnosis or medication. I am just so tired. I know that i should try and do things to help my situation - like doing yoga, eating healthier, sleeping normally and so on.\n\nI just... i dont know anymore. I really hope all of this wasnt a waste of your time. I feel like i am at the edge of my life - finding out if I will either fall down into the abyss of depression and maybe begin to feel suicidal, of if I am going to climb up and see clearly down on the landscape of my life to see 'an answer' to something. I just feel so tired.\n\nThanks in advance for taking your time.\nBest regards.\nEmil. ",

        "body": "Hi I’m 16f and I was hoping I could tell my story and receive some feedback from you guys and it’d be highly appreciated if I could get an opinion from a psychologist or someone well versed in psychology. I just really want to know what’s wrong with me. \n\nDuring my sophomore year things started to change for the worse, I was failing all my classes, feeling exhausted all day, couldn’t sleep and would go to sleep at 3-4am and wake up at 5:30 am every morning, would barley consume anything all day besides my daily energy drink that didn’t help at all, and started developing a complete disregard for my grades and overall future. I also had been self harming (cutting) since freshman year. \n\nMy mom withdrew me from school due to my bad grades and extremely bad attendance saying that she’d switch me to this online school but instead she put it off for months while I sat isolated at home with no reason to ever leave my house since I had no school and no friends I was close enough with to hang out with (I had a best friend before leaving school but her dad forbid her from seeing me after she told him, her cousin, her grandma, and reported me to the school about my cutting after promising she can keep it to herself.) \n\nAfter a while I was enrolled in an online school. that almost catches the story up to the present and I can’t say things have gotten better, the school was the type where you do the work on your own time and pace with the rule that if you are inactive for some time you will be unenrolled. I’d put off the work for days and spend 95% of my time everyday in my room in my bed doing nothing but sleeping and using the internet, until my work was very late and I felt this overwhelming dread when I even thought about opening my laptop to see I’ve been unenrolled so I decided I was just gonna let them unenroll me and when my mom notices she’ll enroll me again and I can try to do better.  \n\nMy mom ended up not saying anything about it. after a few months I was sure that she must know, I was confused about why she hasn’t asked about my school but i didn’t wanna bring it up to her because I didn’t wanna hear how upset she’d be about it. \n\nI’m now at a point where I feel hopeless about life and can’t see a future for myself. I’ve always tried my best to hide how I’ve been feeling from my mom because I don’t want her to feel like a bad parent or cause her emotional distress and I don’t want my family to see me differently, but I’ve started to find it suspicious that she hasn’t noticed anything considering I’ve obviously been struggling in school for some reason, I’m awake all night and then sleep for an excessive amount through the entire day every day, my room is constantly messy and filled with trash everywhere sometimes to the point that you can’t see the floor, I often go weeks without brushing my teeth or showering and I feel so dirty and disgusting but I just can’t bring myself to do everyday things. \n\nI hate most things about myself and don’t think I contribute anything to society and would likely be better off dead but I don’t wanna hurt or traumatize my family, lately I’ve been thinking that maybe it’d be okay for me to just be selfish and end things so I don’t have to continue on like this \n \nSometime after I left school I got a new best friend and she means so much to me for being there and being my friend, I really don’t wanna to let my problems make me  grow apart from her like my best friend from before. But it’s so hard for me to pull myself together and interact with even my own family, I’ve found myself preferring to be alone since socializing is so tiring.\nI’ve also started smoking an excessive amount of weed, I guess I’ve been on a weed bender for the last 3 weeks being high almost completely nonstop. I also tried acid a few weeks ago which is something I would have never even considered in the past, I realized that drugs make you feel better until they don’t.\n\nI feel like the story has been dragging on too long so I’ll end it here, if you read this please leave me some advise or insight on what’s wrong with me or maybe it’s all in my head and I’m just lazy. Feel free to ask questions and thank you for listening to my story \n\n\n\n\n",

So I never have time, and my mental health is pretty bad right now. \nAnd now with taxes probably owing 4k this year, money, being 31 and no where near being able to buy a house, and just LOW motivation. \nYesterday I was scheduled with a \"sub\" psychiatrist so I can get my refills. I had a panic attack at 8am, idk why, probably cause ibdidnt know them? FUN. They're rare with my meds. (GAD, ADHD, Depression)\n\nMy husband struggles with depression and has had suicidal thoughts before.  \n\nI asked him for help, both our cars need tired. This was supposed to be done in September. I try to give him a list if things so it doesn't all fall on me, but he either doesn't do it, or says he doesn't know how to and waits till I do it. \n\nToday he took a \"mental health day\". \n\nI'm extremely pissed off and I've already had and anxiety. He takes off a lot, he only works 4 days a week. He's paid more than me, but I'm salary and he's hourly, so he doesn't get 40 hours all the time. \n\nI'm pissed cause, \n1, money, he spends his money like crazy, eats out breakfast and lunch almost every day. And buys items that are over 60$. So, all bills and rent are thrown to me, I make less. \n2, he's using up his vacation days. We haven't had a vacation in 7 years maybe more, I've lost track. But, he keeps using them PTO or taking the hit, maybe 2 to 3 times a month, or at least late or leaving early. Which gives him points, and that can lead to him being fired. He likes his job, it's the least stressful job he's ever had, and is being paid decently.\n\nI've asked him to bring up this with his psychiatrist, AND his job gives him 15 free therapy sessions a year. But he never does. \n\nI don't want to be pissed off like this, its like a I'm pissed off and overwhelmed. It's not helping my mental health. And I bring this up to him, but then his depression goes HARD afterwards. So then I have that also on my list of things to take care of and walking on eggshells. \n\nPlease be blunt with me. I feel like he's being selfish, but that's selfish of me which makes me feel like shit. \n\nHe's wonderful and this has happened before. But, him taking a mental health day after I had panic attacks yesterday, and just let him know, and that I can't take on all these bills by myself again like last year. I never spend money on items for just me. I don't go shopping i dont \"treat myself\" so I'm the one with the money, even though he makes more. \n\nBut he's taking the mental health day. ",

Eventually my brain caught up to reality and I attempted to end my life by poisoning myself. This led them to just not be able to handle me anymore and leave. And eventually after not dying I realized that I need to really try to fight my mental health. I told them this but I can tell that I put too much stress onto them. Eventually I realized that my stupidity led to a rift in our friendship and I don’t know how to fix it. I do know that they’ll come through when I’m better but I’m too afraid to hurt them like I did before. \n\nI want to improve but I’m afraid of it all falling down and I don’t want them to see me as this crazy person anymore. I know they care about me but my brain and my conscience is fighting over that fact. If I was smarter I wouldn’t had put such a burden on them by telling them so much about my struggle. It’s hard to move past this but I really want to and I want to fix the relationships that I’ve damaged. ",

        "body": "My therapist consistently misunderstands me and my intentions. it's frustrating and I dont know whether this means I should find another one. She sent me a really cold message and ever since I told her I felt sexual attraction to her she became kind of cold. Whatever shit move / response from a therapist to a patient feeling transference but whatever. Anyway, so I sent her a message basically telling her I think it's best if we end the sessions, It was said in a pretty reactive way, but I meant every word. In the next therapy sessions she interpreted that message as me 'game playing'. And trying to say big things for the sake if it. She's missing who I am completely. I am the last person to game play or be manipulative. I am emotionally reactive and act out of this. My message came from an emotional reaction. I felt so hurt and betrayed by her message that my only response was to tell her I didn't want to do therapy with her anymore. She told me to come see her again so we could discuss this so I did go despite saying I think it's best to end it, as per her advice. But to insinuate my message had a manipulative motive, when that's the last thing I am driven by really took me aback. you think it's worth explaining this to her, or you think the right therapist wouldn't misunderstand my intentions like this. I'm a really sensitive person and take a lot to heart, I feel like she doesn't see this. Maybe I dont even show it because she's really attractive so I unconsciously switch my true self off? I'm not sure. But is it standard for a therapist to misunderstand a patient to this extent or is it a sign we are not compatible.",

        "body": "Some backstory, I’m married with 2 young boys and work a commission based job in the plumbing field. So there’s good weeks financially and bad weeks too.\n\nDecember 31st into January 1 I was on call over the weekend and made like 8 grand which was a huge come up, because everybody knows how expensive life is now. I was excited to get ahead on bills and provide the best way I can for my family being the only person working.\n\nThat same week my dog got hit by a car, it cost $400 to put him down, like $2000 to amputate his leg and keep him, which we were going to do but we got an anonymous donation of $5000 to do the surgery and keep his leg. While this was appreciated at the time it hurt us more financially because we had to pay an additional 2-3k for meds and everything else that came into play, then he tore his sutures out while nobody was home 2 weeks later and cost us another 1200, and now recently we find out he broke the metal pin in his leg costing us another few hundred for meds… all that money I made is gone. It’s been super slow since, I got a repo letter on my truck that I’ve been struggling to get ahead of, fortunately I was able to get it refinanced last week…\n\nThen all kinds of issues starting appearing with the truck that are considered warranty but they won’t cover the repairs, then the frame cracked on the front windshield, headliner is soaked from a crack in the back windshield…\n\nAfter the first dog got hit by a car, another beloved dog ate something and got bit by a snake and we had to put her down and bury her because we can’t afford to cremate, then 3 days after that I find out my dad has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. \n\nOn top of all this, my wife is constantly talking about how she wants a divorce because I’m never home, I work so many hours trying to make ends meet. I understand her frustration but I don’t have any choice.\n\nI don’t know, normally I’m so strong and can withstand all this shit but it’s been relentless since the start of this year and I’m worn down significantly. \n\nI’m about to head into work now but I’m sure there were several other things I’ve missed. Any ideas? Anybody been through this kind of crap before?",

        "body": "The treatments for anxiety and depression are not exactly the same, but they have some things in common. For example, relaxation helps with both problems. Reducing stress is good for anxiety and depression. Calming down helps you to think carefully about the thoughts that bother you. Slow breathing is especially good for this. Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg recommend a breathing exercise in the morning and at bedtime for anxiety - breathe gently through the nose, 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out. They say that 20 min of that twice a day is therapy.\n\nA good habit - always respond to a moment of stress by breathing slowly\n\nWhat I usually tell people who have a problem with money -\n\n1) Your GP may be helpful, perhaps in directing your search, helping you with your priorities, or giving you a prescription. You might get help at Mark Cuban's affordable drug company online. This  company is getting a lot of attention lately. Some are saying that it can radically change the drug industry.\n\n2) There's a variety of things that can help - low-cost, low-risk things that are easy and can be combined with each other. I have advice from experts in my comments. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/17o9qp1/comment/k7ynq3p/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/17o9qp1/comment/k7ynq3p/?context=3)\n\n3) Do research, including study of the online therapy reviews. Healthline, a site I rely on for good information, has an article that rates online services.\n\nDo what you can to get a therapist. You may have to do a lot of research about this. Don't give up. Call your local social services (211?) and ask about Medicaid and Obamacare. Also, you can google \"affordable psychotherapy.\" The cost of therapy can vary a lot. \n\n[https://www.healthinsurance.org/obamacare/how-obamacare-improved-mental-health-coverage/](https://www.healthinsurance.org/obamacare/how-obamacare-improved-mental-health-coverage/)\n\n[https://careforyourmind.org/what-to-do-when-you-cant-afford-therapy/](https://careforyourmind.org/what-to-do-when-you-cant-afford-therapy/)\n\nYou can try your local mental health agency. They typically have psychiatric prescribers and tend to take a wide array of insurance."

Later i met a person that i liked a lot, after a longer while of talking we tried being partners.

And on top of it my parents backed my sister saying, \"who's the doctor here, you or her?\" And said \"you feel like you have it because you just started learning about psychology.\" How do i sit them down and make myself clear enough to say that i want to have a test for it?",

It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.\n\nSimple distractions can help - anything that changes your mood like beautiful music."

Apart from her extremely strict views on my academics, social life, future and anything mental health, she is DEVOUTLY religious (Catholic may I add). It's like a match made in hell sometimes. Whilst I've learnt to push away and ignore all her snarky remarks and constant nagging, as soon as she starts talking about God and using him as a justification for EVERYTHING, I genuinely get so frustrated. I am a Catholic myself because I was born into the religion and for the most part I do believe in God, but in a much more freeing and reasonable way than my mother. \n\nFor example, I didn't get into a university degree that I so desperately wanted for which I also worked extremely hard for and her first reaction was to say that I didn't pray hard enough and that I would've gotten in if I prayed extra HOURS of prayer everyday. First of all, I already say like an hour of prayer with her EVERYDAY, because if I don't she'll go hysterical and think the world is going to end the next day. \n\nAnd then if something good does happen to me, or I've worked really really hard for something and end up doing well in it, she'll immediately say that it was because of God and that God allowed me to do well. Everywhere she goes she talks about how God has saved her life and will save mine too... And ig for me and for alot of people God is a sense of hope, but she constantly manipulates everything to suit her view of God, ultimately antagonising me and making me feel horrible.\n\nI know I could just try and ignore her everytime she says this but it genuinely infuriates me because she is so irrational and unreasonable with her thinking and does NOT care about what I say so!!!\n\nLiterally any shared experiences or words of advice/encouragement would be extremely helpful.

        "body": "It sounds to me as if you're looking for actionable recommendations, so I'll go at it from that point of view.\n\nThe sleeping is definitely problematic and it's a terrible cycle, as the lack of sleep is likely to make you more stressed, anxious, and depressed. What helps, for a lot of people, is to practice breathing and a type of body scanning where you tense your muscles and release. I'd highly recommend looking into it and making a conscious effort to practice, as they aren't magical tools, but may help you if you give it a shot.\n\nYou may be in need of therapy, but given your financial situation and how expensive it is, do you have someone close to you in whom you can confide? The ear of someone who cares may not solve your problems, but it could help you feel less alone and burdened. Some countries also provide free mental health care to youths such as yourself, so talk to your general practitioner. They may even be able to help in other ways.\n\nAs for your own efforts, try doing small things each day. Today, you pick up that pair of socks that've been on the floor for a week and tomorrow you take out the trash. It can be really beneficial to start ridiculously small and take your time making it a habit, before branching out to larger tasks. It might feel a bit ridiculous at first, but it'll make sense in a month or two.\n\nI hope that you can somehow benefit from any of these and that you take good care of yourself moving forward. It can be tough, being alive, but there are a lot of great things waiting for you out there, as is true for all of us - you just got to stick around long enough to experience them."

She has put on a good show of being OK by finding projects to complete around the house etc.but never talks about it.\n\nWe have noticed that she has no working memory.  In fact she knows it too and complains that her brain doesn't work anymore.  For example, she has to keep her phone in a fanny pack on her waist. It is very difficult to hold a conversation with her. She forgets who the conversation is about or when the event happened from one moment to the next.  Long term memory is fine.  No issues with knowing how to get around town or even driving a couple hours to another town. She is very frustrated.  She is 82 with no previous health issues or cognitive issues.\nIs this PTSD? Are there treatments that would help?\nThank you!!!\n",

        "body": "I (M19) have been struggling with pretty consistent apathy (I have been told anhedonia is more accurate to what I'm feeling but idk) for I don't even know how long.\n\nI admitted myself to an outpatient general mental health program towards the beginning of january because I was having an incredibly hard time getting motivation to do anything, partially because of anhedonia but at that point I was also having much more anxiety.\n\nI was discharged on friday, and while a lot of the things were helpful for me, I am having a much better time with motivation. But it dosent really feel like motivation. I just make myself do things. I have been going to the gym, working on getting a job, and also working on my freelance furniture business. I plan to go college starting this fall.\n\nThe thing that gets me is that while now I have a much easier time being \"motivated\", I still get absolutely no satisfaction, no joy, and find it incredibly hard to be grateful/appreciative of all of the great things I have going for me. Even with all of the progress I made in the program, specifically with my anxiety and some of my relationships and especially my lifestyle, I still find it impossible to find joy or experience most emotions.\n\nLike, I can identify what I care about and people that I care about, I can identify when something is good and *should* make me happy about it, but I don't get any feelings or fulfillment out of that. Something that does with that is I just feel so disconnected and distant from everyone and everything in my life. I just feel so alien whenever I talk to other people and dont feel connection or love with my friends and family. To an extent I feel like I have felt like this for years and have always been very emotionally numb. But I dont know.\n\nIm just sort of \"frustrated\" because I feel like I really have significantly improved my lifestlye but I still am just ... doing things. I still cannot find any satisfaction. Maybe this has something to do with my ADHD. I am going to keep talking about this with my therapist and psychiatrist but it is just so exhausting to get absolutely no satisfaction or joy out of life. The world just seems so far away from me and I am tired of it",

Because I was smart and used to love subejects like maths and science, was kind of a nerd. \n\nThen in senior year of high school I found out about my family secrets which I don’t want to reveal here. But they were tough on me, also I was in a new school where I never made any friends cuz they had completely different background. It took a hit on me. I just went into complete depression. Didn’t perform well in exams, I used to feel like I’ve lost half of my brain somewhere. But until that point I knew nothing about mental health and stuff. \n\nGot into college somehow, not the college I wanted but just good enough. In that four years I was good with people and all but again I was in completely different city and had zero self esteem. I couldn’t barely pass my exams. Used to have constant anxiety and stuff. I always felt I don’t have a home… \n\nThen somehow got a corporate job during covid I used to love the field it was in so it was good for first few years. But then shift happened. I started hating that job cuz I was tired of the work, and seniors were rude and unfriendly. So I resigned, the pain was too much to bear. I was having anxiety attacks by the end of that job. \n\nFor the past few months I got many job offers, even in this market. But I rejected them all. I just don’t want to move to any other city and start from scratch. I just don’t think I’ll ever feel connected with people no matter what I do. \nI’m good at what I do. So I won’t be unemployed for a long. But it’s the mental health that’s what coming in the way. I just can’t seem to find any other way around it. I will be always lonely. What should I do now?\n\nPs: I am going through therapy. And it is good so far but you can’t make friends just by therapy right? Also I went through a terrible relationship during my college years , and I don’t have any courage left for dating. ",

Many people around me were superficial and just wanted to use me and I didn’t like that at all. I erected many large boundaries around me because of those experiences and to this day I’m still trying to tear them down. I have a loving family, gf, and a great friend group but I still feel like I don’t fit it. I still feel like I don’t fit into my family, I don’t belong on a healthy relationship, nor do I fit with my friends. Part of this is because of my boundaries, I just have too many of them and I’m terrified of what will happen if I let them down. But hey that’s okay, everyone is living life for the first time so let them make mistakes and learn from them. If you move to a new city and new environment who is to say what will be good or bad? \n\nThe whole dating thing will always figure itself out, you just have to put yourself out there, even if it means shooting your shot with any attractive girl you come in contact with. Being so young I wouldn’t worry about dating. \n\nTherapy is a good start, keep at it, it’s not easy but eventually it will pay off."

He's been under an incredible amount of stress the last several months (esp with the way he feels he needs to parent myself and others in the house) but I still just... have a hard time feeling the desire to take care of him?\n\nIt's not that I don't want to! I care about him a lot and I want him to be happy and healthy but those feelings just feel like they aren't there. Same goes for things like guilt over stuff I've done in the past-- like, these feelings SHOULD be easy to grasp and use in my efforts to care but they don't just come naturally. I tend to just not think about things that I could or should be doing to show care.\n\nI think I've fully detached myself from my feelings. I went through some pretty bad social trauma near the start of the pandemic and I feel like that might've been a part of it? I don't think I have a personality disorder like ASPD or anything like that (I was very emotional when I was younger, and with a LOT of focus and effort I have recently been able to kind of force myself to have an emotional reaction to certain things). I am pretty sure my emotions are in there, they just feel so deeply buried as to be inaccessible.\n\nPlease help me, I don't know what to do. I just want to be there for my partners and I want to love them and feel joy with them again but that all feels out of reach and I feel so miserable about how much grief my inability to feel has caused.",

Im an advocate for taking advantage of people being decent, treating me with respect and love, then shitting on them for even more self gratification.\n(Yeah i know what your thinking) thats pretty fuct up man, i know eh! Gets even worse tho!!! Fuckin worse! I am 38 now going into my 39th year. a year i plan on getting my fucking shit together. And start feeling/being a MAN. What does that mean you say... to be a man? Well i feel we can all interperate that differently. But before get into that let me explain a bit more. I grew up with a pretty solid child hood. Youngest of 4 2 boys 2 girls. Played sports when i was an adolescent. Had some friends. Not alot but some in public school. Not to say i was different but i was the first and only fat kid in my age group in school. So you know what that comes with, being bullied then bullying typical shit i would say. Through grades 7 through grade 10 1lish (didnt finish high school) my father wasn't around much.\nNot that i am holding that against him! (Hes now dead) but worked his fucking ass off for his family.\n(Showing me how to pack all my feelings away and bury myself in work) But that left me to be raised by my bros and sisters and an Alcoholic Mother who only knew how to show 2 types of love. conditional love and love for the bottle. What does this have to do with the title of my blog? Well i am just curious if there is anyone else like me out here. Who learned how to love shittaly. And want to over come it to create a healthy relationship. How not to seek peoples approval through self gratification, lies, cheating, stealing. To ask the questions, what fuct me up, where did i go wrong. How did i only get to know this type of love/respect. How did i not discover this was wrong earlier in life? I have a fuck load of questions to ask and want to know who can relate.\nSo please follow along as i do the impossible, working through feelings, emotions traumas. To improve for myself and others. We werent born this way!! We were taught!\n\n",

We can't guarantee we won't pass our mental health issues down to our kids, but managing your own mental health (which sounds like you do) is the best thing you can do for your kids. You'll be a better parent, and if you realize down the road that your kids are also struggling with the same mental health issues, by managing your own as well as you can with proper and appropriate support and treatment you can help guide your kid through their struggles too. Be a bit of a roadmap for them just like parenting with a lot of things will be. Best of luck to you and your new growing family!"

        "body": "Congratulations! How exciting. I’m not a parent but my close friends have had kids so I’ve seen what that did. I recommend getting clued up on the birth process, there are plenty of YouTube videos on peoples births and I think this will help prepare you both. And then there are plenty of books and videos on what the first 3 months is like with a baby and around feeding round the clock. You want to make sure you both get enough sleep. ESP mum since she’s up Breast Feeding in the night if she chooses to do that. And you need to work out timings so she can have a lie in and sleep etc. Also our friends organised Meal Trains which there’s a website for. So friends can sign up for a day or more to make dinner and bring round which you can eat and or freeze. Because the first few months are so hands on and Tiring. \n\nThe next thing that happens is connecting with others that are having babies also to share the process with. And you can look up parenting styles. I personally hate it but hen babies are put to bed then left to cry. Doesn’t feel right at all. I think children that know mum and dad are there for them when they need actually grow up more secure and confident as they know they have parents as a foundation. \n\nEnjoy the process and prepare yourself to fall completely in love with your child and your partner more. \n\nHope some of that helps"

We'd all get a couple of hours from 6-8 am then my wife would take over.  You need to find what works best for you guys.\n\nkeep talking, keep supporting each other, and you'll be fine.\n\nAlso, if you hang clothes out to dry, but a crap load of more clothes pegs, babies get through clothes at a rate you've never seen before and as they are smaller, you'll hang more on the line and need more pegs :)"

        "body": "Don’t hesitate to lean on your supports BEFORE you hit a mental health crisis - this can help you avoid depression/mania/psychotic break etc (whatever your flavor is) BEFORE it happens.  Really dig into your childhood issues in therapy.  IFS, EMDR, Somatic therapy, etc.  If you haven’t already, this is a good time to start your “healing journey” from any trauma or childhood issues you have.  some people are in therapy but are afraid to be totally vulnerable and honest with the therapist, and even honest with themselves.  this work cant be rushed, but you dont need to worry because you absolutely have time,  You can heal this stuff while being a parent.  you do not have to be perfect and \"fully healed\" (whatever that means) to be a good parent.  you can make your mental health a priority while still taking care of your child.  I think being a parent is also a great opportunity to challenge some of your own assumptions about what life is and how things have to be, since children see the world through fresh eyes.  \n\ni grew up with 2 mentally ill/mentally disabled parents and i wish they had been in therapy when i was a kid.  so its healing to my inner child to see that you are doing this as you become a parent ❤️❤️❤️"

        "body": "So, around 2 years ago in November I had gone to a show with a friend. This was the first time I ever predicated in the substance Molly ( MDMA ) and all was well, took another pill and all was well, stupidity took over me and I took another point of crystal mdma. I started to feel really awkward, hot dry inside just plain weird and not good towards the end of the show. So I get some water in me walk back to the car and all is well. Drive to the buddy's house to grab some more favors and them head too a relatives house to keep the party going. There we did some coke, drank a little bit smoked some weed. Some dropped some acid, I had a peice in my hand for a few minutes contemplating dropping it but figured I was already fucked up and there was no need at all for another substance at this point. I was still there mentally and physically I was just really fucked up. Keep on mind that I've always struggled with mental health dating back too like 5th grade with social anxiety depression and a bit of adhd. Never throughout the night was I anxious at all or anything of the sorts other than the come up, I was a bit anxious as it was a brand new feeling lol. But we're all sitting on the bed just talking listening to music and we had done some coke were smoking some weed and all of a sudden I get this weird ass headache, like really awful really bad headache. The beat way I can explain it is litteraly feeling as if my braincells were fucking breaking/self destructing, like it was IN my head and in super pinpoint spots and stuff, very very weird and too this day I've never had anything of the sorts occur since in the severity it was. But the part about mental health here is that around 15 or ao minutes after this head ache I start to get really anxious, like the worst I've ever had, paranoia vs anxiety type deal. And I feel as if my buddy start to reccord me and that there all laughing at me, this wasn't happening at all but I kept thinking it and the feeling got worse to the point I confronted him about it. We got in some weird argument over it and then it really got bad, I felt like there was cameras in the lamps and shit. Obviously a drug induced phscosis moment, that's not the point. To this day I feel as if I'm part of some fucking elaborate joke that I don't understand and it really messes with my head. Logically I know this isint true at all, but my thoughts argue against it and you think what you feel, so I feel so fucking anxious around anyone at all family random people ect, I have since ceased drug use. It was almost immediate for all hard drugs and took me a while for a 30 days sober streak with weed but I got it. I just dint understand after all this time why it's still so sever with this one issue. I know that it's not true. It's not logical. It's just silly, but I can't actually convince myself of that. What do I do I'm so tired of being a walking ball of anxiety at work and in public. I just feel so awkward and stared at and like I'm some weird person that everyone plots against. I know its not true but I won't belive it i just don't get it. ",

        "body": "Word of the wise, don't use your brain or body as a dumpster for all illicit drugs all at once...or you'll have the experience you just described! As an addictions counselor, the  fact that your did multiple substances that all are from different drug classes and create opposing effects from one another....yeah, you're going to feel like you're losing your mind....because you are! I'll also point out that after doing something like that, don't be surprised if you don't ever really get back to how you were before. For example, MDMA floods your brain with serotonin and dopamine...but there is never a guarantee that after your fun and high is over your brain will return to it's previous equilibrium. And that's just one substance, add in all the others that you used at the same time....you can put yourself into a substance induced psychosis with any one of those drugs let alone all of them. And a substance induced psychosis sometimes can't be reversed either! I've seen it happen, more than once. It's not what you want to experience. And keep in mind, taking acid is a different experience than taking MDMA. The part of thinking your friend was recording you, but it wasn't actually happening was most likely a hallucination, not a drug induced psychosis moment. Psychosis doesn't have moments....they have episodes that last several days, weeks and beyond! \n\nThe bigger question I have is, why are you taking so many drugs at the same time? What's the point or main objective? If you're wanting to get messed up, one substance will do!  If you're trying to manage your mental health, try talking to a therapist to handle your anxiety but never self medicate with substances...especially on this level. You're gambling your life!"

But, the question is, why do I still feel as of I'm part of the same joke today? I no longer suffer from most of the things but there still are some weird thoughts and ect. I do understand that it won't nessicareily return to the same balance and that it could take a tremendous amount of time too happen even if it dose. But why? I quit doing cocaine, I haven't touched mdma in over a year. I have tripped on mushrooms here and there and I am an avid daily smoker. But I don't think those have nessicareily negative effects on my emotions of thought process. The mushrooms have helped a lot with returning to that normal or learning a new one atleast. And the weed honestly is just a bad habit that relaxes me. But with the cessation of real drug use and abuse, my question is why do I still feel like that people are \" in one on big joke \" that I'm not a part of and there all working in harmony towards. My brain and mind understand that in just not fesiable. It's illogical and just not true. But I still feel that way and I have those thoughts and really try but can't seem ti break the thought loop."

        "body": "I obviously don't know you, so I'm not sayin this is exactly what's happening to you, but I'll give you a good general example of what can happen in these instances. \n\nThis happens fairly commonly with meth users, where they may have not had much mental health issues before becoming a meth user/addict, But, overtime of consistent and high tolerance use of meth can work them into substance induced psychosis. They can be treated, stabilized and brought back to their baseline....however, it has happened that their brain chemistry and their cognitive abilities have been compromised from such use of meth that they have now become schizophrenic! That cannot be reversed, but only managed at best. \n\nSo, by providing that example...it may be a situation that after *all* of that polysubstance use you've done...it may have changed your brain and cognitive state and abilities to where you have residual and lingering effects from it. It'd be best to talk with an addictions therapist who has knowledge about substance abuse and possible a neurologist if you want to know more of the state of your brain. That might be a process to get approved or referred to one, but it would be interesting to know if there really have been brain changes in your chemistry and  cognitive processing from all of that drug use. \n\nThis is why doing this is sooooooooo dangerous! Do not think it's \"just a good time\", it's not! There's serious long term effects that can happen that are largely out of your control, and may not be able to be reversed."

All this has been weighing on me and I've been unsure on what to do or what actions to take to better it or atleast find answers on what's going on. So, I will be talking to my normal care doctor about some of it and seeing if she can get me into or atleast a recommendation to a neurologist or something of that sorts. Much appreciated."

        "body": "The best thing you can do is stop all substance use and remain sober. Even the weed! I mean, stone cold sober! This will give your brain the chance to heal and get back to baseline. The fact that you're only 16 is also concerning in the sense that your brain is still very much developing and the extreme use of substances can damage/throw off that process. Which is why I strongly urge you to abstain from substances! You've compromised yourself a lot at this point. This may even be a wake up call for you to change other things in your life, like the friends you hang out with and the pressures of doing whatever else everyone  is getting into....but do literally put yourself in a position where some of this may not be reversible is not worth it. Straighten yourself up, get some help for staying sober and talk to your Dr (and be very honest) about what you can do moving forward to prevent any further damage. I don't mean to raise any anxiety you already have about all this, but even as a addictions counselor...this is extremely concerning! Best of luck to you!"

What i mean by this is a lot of mental health issues (Since she never was at a therapist they arent actually diagnosed but very real) and her parents or anyone else really doesnt seriously help her. They (My girlfriend and her mom) will go to a doctor soon but they will likely just give her pills to take. Her mom doesn't believe her and just thinks its all hormones. (Not saying she is completely bad or anything) My girlfriend has also difficulties expressing herself which is why she cant just say she wants to disppear from this world and say how she is actually doing. I really dont know anymore how to help her, she is losing hope and i dont know what to do anymore. A few days ago she wrote her mom by text about how she is feeling and now they are going to a doctor, as mentioned before, but her mom still didn't take her seriously which made my girlfriend want to never talk to anyone again even more. If i didnt give enough information just ask what you need to know in the comments. \\^\\^\r  \nTL;DR \"What can i do to help her?\"",

I am out of time.\n\nI am 35. Since I was a child, I dreamed of having a family of my own. The want to be a mother has always been extremely strong for me. I even stated volunteering in the kindergarten classes of my elementary school when I was in grade 5. I wanted to learn about children and how to help them become good people. This followed me all the way through to high school where I continued volunteering in daycares and schools.\n\nI went to college for Early Childcare Education. I worked as a nanny. I learned how to cook healthy meals. I was set on preparing myself to be a wife and mother some day..\nI got trapped in an abusive relationship when I was young... I had to make a choice that destroyed me to my core.. He wasn't the man I wanted to have a child with.. I didn't want to continue the cycle of a single mom running from a monster ex.. I didn't want my child to live life I had to... I had to let the soul go. Telling myself that they will come back to me when I find the right man for us..\n\nI thought I found him many many years later.. We had a plan.. Covid happened.. A bunch of things happened..important people died.. Our plans died.\n\nI am 35 now.. My mental health has been getting steadily worse.. I can't help but cry every night. I can't work with children as I often times will breakdown. I am in physical pain every day.. There is no way I could take care of anyone anymore.. And yet my whole being is screaming out for a family...\n\nIt feels like I am drowning within myself.. I do not have a want for life anymore.. I know I can never have a family now. It is too late. I am alone. Just wanting to let go of these dreams that are turning into nightmares..\n\nLogic says it is too late. I am too weak now to be a good parent. Im too broken to do it alone. I Don't have enough money. I don't have a way to make things better on my own. I don't want to be a single mom because I want my chil to have a life I didn't have.. A happy one.. And I can't offer that.. It is selfish to want a family now.. I am too weak and broken and old. No one really wants me anymore. \n\nThis is way beyond any baby fever I have ever read about. This all power want and need to have a family had been my driving force behind everything I ever did for so long. It is a part of who I am. Letting go of it is ripping a large part of myself put... I don't have anything to put in it's place.. I feel like a shell of a person.. \n\nI can't stop living, because my mom needs me. I have to pretend I'm ok for her.. But I am exhausted.. I am suffering.. I am deeply broken. I don't know how to find new meaning in life. I can't find anything else that seems worthwhile to live for after she is gone.. I don't know what my point is anymore...\n\nHow do I let go? How can I just \"be\" knowing I have no future? Everything I did and learned is for nothing.. \n",

But everyone grows at their own pace and if you don’t feel ready to meet other people and they don’t come to you naturally, you could use an AI tool to fill that void for now - like PI AI. I have found some success with it, it is not the best for everything. In regards to the disconnecting thing, i find I’m here or I’m not, and when I am not “real” it is because I am hiding from the world. It is ok to hide if you need to, but if i want to become present to a point i have to address what I’m  hiding from. A nice walk in nature does the trick too, obviously not snap bang magic back into reality, but it helps. Breath slowly and focus on your physical body being in the world, maybe try meditating. Peace and stability could come or it could not, that’s a strong maybe, but there are lots of people who come from bad places and end up in good ones through their own sheer determination and help from kind people. Do not give up on yourself, don’t rush your life, take as long as you need, it is ok."

That feeling of \"I'm not real\" or \"I'm false\" or \"my reality is false\" sounds pretty familiar though. If you have concerns, could be time to seek out some support from a professional.\n\nAs for the social stuff, have you met anyone who might be feeling similar? It's tough to open up about it, but it can pay dividends. In my experience, people are pretty receptive when you say \"I'm going through a tough time because xyz\". These conversations can bring you much closer and help you feel less isolated, and it's really common, especially in your mid-20's. You might want to seek out some in-person peer support groups if available in your area - great place to vent!\n\nDM's are open."

        "body": "A lot of people are mentioning dissociation, and I have to agree. To give you a quick breakdown of what this is: \n\n*Dissociation* is feeling disconnected from yourself and the world around you. You may feel like you're not real, or the world around you isn't real. Some people describe it as feeling like they're underwater or in a deep brain fog. You go into almost an NPC mode where you're just carrying out actions out of habit but not really making any decisions.\n\n*Depersonalization* can be an aspect of dissociation and is specifically the feeling of being deattatched from yourself. If you've ever looked at yourself in the mirror and felt like you were looking at a stranger or like you don't recognize yourself, that's a form of depersonalization. \n\nEveryone will experience some dissociation and depersonalization from time to time, but it sounds like you've been experiencing them a lot. I'm sorry, first of all, I've been there and it sucks. For me, it was actually just a symptom of really intense anxiety, and once I started treating that the dissociation/depersonalization symptoms went away, although I still experience them when I'm really anxious. \n\nThat was just my experience and yours could obviously be something totally different, but I just wanted to say I get it and you're not alone. People *would* notice if you dissappear. Even just by posting this, you've provided a way for all these commenters to come together and connect in a community with shared experiences, which wouldn't have happened if you hadn't posted.\n\nFor me, therapy and excercise (especially outside in nature) helped a lot, which I know is an annoyingly simple answer. Utilize your online communities until you can find people who understand you in-person! Reddit and discord have lots of active communities that can help you feel connected to others :) \n\nI'm sorry you're going through this! Sending all the virtual hugs and support xx"

        "body": "Hii, I have DPDR (depersonalization derealization disorder) and it sounds like you might have it too. My DPDR gets triggered by stress, I am assuming because you are stressed over the bar exam and it’s basically “consuming” you, that is probably what’s making you disassociate. I have experienced something very similar to you, during college application season my mom put a lot of pressure on me to get into a good school and I was CONSUMED by college prep while keeping up with my normal life. College prep was all that was in my head 24/7 and to cope with it I guess my DPDR was triggered and I would go into “autopilot mode”. My college prep took all of my time and I lost contact with my friends and I would barely interact with my family. Isolation makes DPDR worse because you aren’t interacting with “reality,” so I would recommend go outside in nature, try to talk to people, another thing that helped me was constantly reminding myself I am real, like set an alarm every 30 minutes or however often you need and close your eyes and feel every part of your body, from every toe to finger to your head. I know it’s scary, because there would be times where I would look in the mirror and not recognize myself, but you learn to live/cope with it eventually. Also, the more attention you give it the worst it becomes, so don’t actively think about it, if you can help it. I was 16 when it started and now I am 19 and slowly it has gotten better, I started taking meds and I also do cognitive therapy to help overcome. Also try to live a day at a time don’t get stressed over things in the future because what’s the worse that can happen? If you fail the bar you can take it again or you can go into a different career. I always try to remember a problem that seemed so big to me at one point in life like getting into a good college, but here I am now, life goes on and I look back and think the worst that could happened was I wouldn’t get into a college of my liking but I would get into some college, if not there was always community college. Try not being so hard on yourself, okay? My dad tells me don’t get hung over and stressed over issues you can’t solve, just move on. If hadn’t gotten into the college I wanted, there was nothing I could have done so getting obsessed over it and constantly being in my head about it would not change the outcome. Rather think what can I do today to solve this issue that is realistic and feasible. For starters you can interact with your family a little bit more if that’s an option, maybe get a dog so you are outside more and the cute little things they do always brings a smile lol, and idk what advice to give you on making friends because I don’t have any lol. But I have my family and 3 friends that I know are always there for me and I have just learned to love my own company, trust me you feel at peace when you are not trying to carry the burden and stress of the world. And there are obviously gonna be days that are bad, just take a break and start fresh tomorrow, because you waking up each morning is a accomplishment in itself and slowly you will start to brush you teeth, maybe change clothes, or take a shower, drink water and so on. When you are struggling the little things like drinking a sip of water is something! So focus on your accomplishment and reset, because if you choose there will always be another day to restart. Take a break, it’s okay to take a break:) Sorry wrote a whole with A LOT of grammatical errors lol but I know what you are going through because I went through it and still in the process. I know when you are in situations like this it’s easier said than done, once you realize everything will workout you will be fine. I know it!:) ps some people just have an episode of DPDR when the stress goes away it will go away with it, continued on for three years on going…because I like to take the burden of the world and absolutely stress and overthink every aspect of my life lol Again sorry for making the reply so long!"

I was worrying sooo much about all sorts of 'what if's' and was mistaken in believing that seeing a/some therapist(s) with whom I don't have a profound connection or mutual understanding from the get-go would not only be less than optimal but would have some mysterious, undefined catastrophic consequences on my well-being that I couldn't afford to have added to my struggles. All that to say, you may not be as neurotic and inclined to terrify yourself with random fantasies like that, but if you feel unsure or stressed about finally lookin for a therapist, I recommend googling things like ''how to find the riight therapist'' and similar inquiries and reading from a few of the search results. This can give a lot of insights and help dispell many misconceptions we all tend to have before having truly experienced therapy.\n\nApart from that, there's a few things I would definitely consider if I was in your place (and I've been  thru some phases/states that felt awfully similar to what you're describing):\n\n\\- How do you feel about/what experiences do you have with pets? Have you ever had one or more that you enjoyed having in your life? If you have an affinity for dogs, cats or some other pet, I feel that starting to take care of one and develop a bond with it through daily nurturing could potentially do wonders for a LOT of the distressing things you are experiencin/feeling lately.\n\n*(I would definitely go in that direction rather than for the 'AI CHAT BUDDY' that have been suggested. I do not have experience with them, but I really feel like beyond being a distraction, this can't be a source of any real nourishment for your spirit/heart/wtv you want to call it and my intuition tells me that it could on the contrary have some weird effects on people that aren't totally unrelated to this sense of not feeling 'real' that is already burdening you. Just my two cents, but yeah)*\n\n\\-Have you ever looked into/tried journaling? For me, it's a practice that has unlocked SO much for me and made most other aspects of my life feel less grueling and more enriching, notably by providing me with a way better understanding of myself and all that chaotic mess that constituates 'me' and 'my life', even the stuff I felt was too confusing & impossible to understand for me. I can't vouch for or even really talk about other approaches to journaling and their possible benefits as I only am experienced with going for the 'automatic writing route'.\n\nI will let a better source than I explain it to you to avoid misleading you with a rushed answer, I'm fallin asleep as I'm typing this. I personally first learned about this practice through author Julia Cameron in her book 'The Artist's Way', which is a program she made a while ago to help creative people struggling with harnessing their creative power, tapping into the source of inspiration and finding their voice as an artist, but I think that the journaling practice she suggests in there has the potential to be a major life-changer for everyone, artistically inclined or not at all.  what I'm referring to is what she calls the ''**Morning Pages'**' in the book:\n\n[Morning Pages | Julia Cameron Live](https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/)\n\nThis is the first result I laid my eyes on after googling these 2 words and since it comes from the author I'm referring to it is probably a decent introduction to the concept, but if you don't really get what it's all about, how it could benefit you or how to do it after checking the link, I highly encourage you to google it and take in a few perspectives on that practice - I am not exagerating when I say that letting the chaotic storm of thoughts that used to plague my mind constantly freely flow out of me onto a page, without censoring, planning, editing, hesitating, stopping to think about what to say, and whatever form of control one can imagine, has been more transformative than pretty much anything else besides exercice and meditation, and on top of this, this journaling practice has been what finally allowed me to find the stillness that allows me to sink into truly impactful meditative states and unlocked it for me after trying and finding nothing but frustration for a long time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApologies for the very meaty answer, for some reason reading your post and recognizing so much of what has plagued me in the past and being reminded of how lost and hopeless I felt in those times got me very enthusiastic to share what has helped me in ways I couldn't have imagined when in the midst of those feelings. I hope that anything I've said will at least inspire thoughts in you that will bring hope and some direction. Best of luck friend!"

        "body": "Well, first I should mention that I'm not a therapist, just someone with a lot of mental health knowledge from my own stuff and my job. But if you do experience long-term depersonalization and derealization like that, it could be worth looking into Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder, which is basically when a Depersonalization or derealization episode is long-lasting (weeks, months, and even years) or occurs frequently. But long-term depersonalization and derealization like that could be caused by other mental health issues, particularly chronic trauma, anxiety, or depression. \n\nSo to answer your question: yes! but at that point it's usually linked to a mental health disorder.

Think of it being the transitional period, the medium, 0.5 on a 0 to 1 spectrum of dissociation and grounded. I tell myself that my spirit/soul is assigned to my physical body to experience life as a human, I am responsible to take care of it from harm and stay as one to fully immerse myself. We tend to give ourselves less kindness and patience, be overly critical of self as people, but when you think of your physical body as a separate being (accept that you feel detached, face it, and then return to your body) it may be easier to feel/regain this sense of empathy and sympathy for self."

        "body": "Your brain is putting you in that headspace as an attempt at protection. What others are suggesting with mindfulness and grounding techniques is challenging that automatic response from the brain and gives it something new to focus on. Overtime with practice you can “trick” your brain and make yourself feel comfortable. By the way it’s a lot easier said than practiced be easy with yourself. \n\nAlso when I’m feeling this way sometimes I feel like I have also lost all sense of agency. I can tell you that by finding someone you trust (preferably a professional therapist) and having an honest conversation with whatever your feeling can help to normalize those feelings and if it’s someone you really trust their beliefs can help outweigh some of the distorted negative thoughts about yourself. When we are alone our perspectives can become distorted and it’s all normal, just an attempt the brain is making to make us feel safe. \n\nCheck out Tara Brach meditations and podcasts see if her work resonates with you."

        "body": "For the past three months, I have been very up and down with my feelings, I have gone from nothing happening in my life, just living peacefully to having Godzilla blasting a bunch of problems in my face. \n\nSince December, I've had fleas in my house, my parents splitting up, a mild but not fun outbreak of hormonal acne, my boyfriend leaving me, my friends leaving me and I've had nothing to do but stay indoors all day starring into mirrors, hating myself, completely bored, lonely and anxious. I've also done nothing to deserve these problems, I haven't been horrible or cruel or emotional in front of anyone. \n\nAs you can see the struggle is real! Nevertheless, I am not giving up and neither should you. There is always help, always someone or something, always positives. I haven't really experienced that many problems in life until now so excuse me if my encouragement is a little childish, but I really feel nobody is hopeless or a lost cause. I mean just hearing my problems makes me sound like a wreck, but I am still here, achieving top grades, going to the gym daily, focusing on using acidic serums on my face and am now in a \"skin purging phase\" where all the acne and gunk comes to the surface, making me look terrible (I don't really look terrible) but I feel terrible sometimes. \n\nNo matter what, no matter how hard life gets. I will always know there's something I can do, something I can try, someone I can see to help me, ways I can help myself and I won't give up until I achieve what I want, I will not settle for logical or realistic approaches like \"This divorce and my skin problems are going to cause me a lot of problems in life\" no no no! I am going to be okay, I may break down and fall back down often, but I am resilient enough to not give up or succumb to what's been thrown at me. \n\nAs I said, always remember there is someone, something and somewhere you can do or do to better yourself and help yourself. I know its so impossible sometimes to get out of your feelings, your head is a cruel place often, but inside your mind also lies the ability to get better, to feel better. \n\nI hope this helps, I've just learnt today that the best thing you can do sometimes is just do it, so im just gonna post this even if its unhelpful or silly :D",

I have noticed the past 3-4 months I’ve eaten maybe 1000 calories a day (if I’m lucky, mostly I’ll eat a cup or yogurt or applesauce, and something else when dinner or lunch time comes around for me). I never ever eat this little, and I’m feeling full really fast. I’m overweight, but move a LOT at work and when I go out. I never eat anything that too horrible for your health. It’s not any medicine changes that are doing it, because I’m unmedicated, (unless you count weed). It just happened one day and it hasn’t stopped. I think the absolute worse part is being chubby but eating as if I’m 100lbs. This is starting to bother me, and makes me anxious thinking about. I’ll feel my stomach growl, don’t feel like being in the mood for any food, but eventually grab SOMETHING to snack on or eat. But I’ll get full after maybe a half of a cheese burger or a small bowl of cereal will fill me up. I don’t want to feel full, but I feel so full like I’m gonna puke if I keep going. Does anyone else have this issue? I’ve been trying to find out if it’s linked to depression, bpd, or I might have something internally wrong. I’m most asking, because I don’t think it’s depression making me not hungry, because I’ll feel the hunger and eat, but never ever much, always just a few bites. ",

        "body": "Hi,\n    \n     I feel horribly sick from this and have for days. I'm just looking for support. Maybe somebody has been through something similar.\n    So a little over a week ago on Sunday night, I took my last dose of Sertraline (Zoloft) 50mg. I had been trying to get refills before that point, but couldn't. The  doctor who prescribed it wanted to see me in as he hadn't seen me in a year. However I don't have mountains of money like he does so I can't really go see him for something dumb where he'll just say \"Ok here are some refills\" without even examining me. This doctor doesn't examine and his reviews agree with me. \n    Anyway, I didn't expect to have super bad withdrawal symptoms since my mom used to be on Zoloft years ago, quit cold turkey, and had little to no issues. I was wrong. \n⚠️TMI⚠️\n    First I had bad diarrhea for a couple days, that was manageable. Then I had a flare of my previous anxiety symptoms (e.g. uncontrollable crying for hardly any reason, irrational thinking, isolation from other people) a couple evenings after the diarrhea, also manageable. Then a week into not taking the Zoloft (last Sunday), I got really sick. I had terrible body aches, angry throat glands, major fatigue, and a low fever.  I had to stay in bed almost all day, it felt like the flu. Now, from about 9pm last night to present, my throat hurts terribly and I've just finished about 30 minutes of a panic attack that scared both my dogs and myself.\n     I went to work yesterday and felt alright, just slightly under the weather like allergies or something. But after this attack on top of everything else, I don't know what to do. I was sobbing, screaming, hyperventilating, and having self harm thoughts that I luckily didn't act on. I knew I looked and sounded insane but I couldn't make it stop. It really freaked me out. The last meltdown that strong that I remember having was probably a year and half/2 years ago. I had been on the Zoloft for about a year until last week. \n    Has anyone else experienced symptoms like this after quitting antidepressants cold turkey? I have tried virtual doctors visits and they won't help me either. I'm fully blaming my previous doctor for this BS as I was given no heads up. I'm only 21 and still trying to figure out my medical care so I would've appreciated an annual appointment reminder or SOMETHING. I even have an account made on their stupid hospital app where I can access messaging to his techs and I still got zero heads up. I'm fuming at this rich pos and that's really not helping me. Lol.

We do this, because for some people it is easier to talk about their feelings when they are asked questions. But we also hope, that when you see others respond to this question, you feel less alone. And it can be a conversation started in the comments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n ***What is your favorite form of self-care?***",

As a 17 year old I think I'll disagree, I've been bored and lonely all year, I've gotten into University, I've never looked better. But I'm so lonely and bored waiting around for Uni, for better social life and experiences. I do nothing all day and night and its driven me insane, I'm anxious, worrying about nothing, depressed and somehow insecure because I have so much time on my hands to stare about 1 inch away from a mirror all day even though I know how attractive I am already. Don't worry, I'm getting better, going gym more, socialising more etc. But generally I feel like in some cases and my mum was the same. 17 can get so boring and prison-like, because you're stuck waiting around to go out, to get a job or uni, to move on in life, and for smart motivated people, I think the waiting and being surrounded by people with zero motivation no offence to them of course as everyone's different and its challenging to know what to do in life, can get super dull and lonely.  \n\nDoes anyone understand this? Or am I alone, my mum also said 17 was her worst year because of how miserable life gets and lonely you get when you just want to meet people like you, with interests and intents like yours. ",

I'm more lonely now at age 35 and have a lot more stress. Life passes by faster each year.\n\nAlso, you're only 17 one year of your life, so even if it feels like a prison it's very temporary. Would love to be in your shoes because I really liked my university days, when you get my age you no longer have that to look forward to.\n\nSounds like I have a shitty life or a midlife crisis but I really don't. I have a great life, I'm content and still have a lot of stuff to look forward to in my future. There's just something beautiful to just starting one's adult life with all it entails."

Like, you can still grow up to become as hot as it's  possible you can still grow up to earn as much money as possible, ypu can still learn every skill, you can still get yourself a huge social circle etc. Etc. And simultaneously  you're not to young to do most things anymore (well except for the ones ypu mentioned). But yeah of course that also comes with anxiety and pressure and those things can really fuck your life up. So I'd say priority number 1 should be to take good care of yourself and your mind and don't  let anyone tell ypu what you should or shouldn't ne doing and don't  hang out with people that drag you down"

From my experience it's very far from the truth.  The best bits of being a teen were being free of social expectations, for coloring my hobbies and interests with so much time and freedom.

I recommend developing a healthy hobby like running, cycling, weight lifting, that you can tie goals to. Intense physical exercise will relieve a lot of anxiety, stress, and overthinking, while providing good feelings. Accomplishing goals makes you feel good too and you get stronger or better conditioned."

Everyone’s experiences are different but my senior year I decided to say fuck it and make friends before I left and had a party to go to every weekend the summer before college. I think that something you’ll learn as time goes on is that you need to be able to find happiness no matter where you are. To think that University will be better and putting all your hope on it is dangerous, especially if it doesn’t turn out the way you want. Before I left for college I had to go to therapy because of my anxiety when thinking about it, and honestly that helped a lot. It was through my local county government so it was cheaper if money is an issue for you. You should take pride in your looks and your age, being 17 sucks because you don’t have all the advantages of being 18 but you can still have fun while waiting. I say put your anxiety about college into messaging future people who are going to your University on social media to make friends, make friends with people you already know who are going, and build a social media presence if you haven’t already, so that even if you’re nervous, you know you’re doing everything you can to set yourself up for the future. No matter how bad the point in time is I think that everyone misses it a little bit and maybe you’ll do the same later on. Take advantage of your youth and not having any responsibilities before college. Spend your money on things you love, travel, become who you truly want to be and things will fall in line for you."

I am self-aware enough to know that I should use the peacefulness and the lack of anyone expecting anything of me for positive, I think I will once I just move past this stage of anxiety and really realise how lucky I am."

My mum says she feels lonely sometimes but she lives in a big house, with a great job and is surrounded by great people (me lmao) and she's seeking out more opportunities too like starting a career in writing and going gym more often with me.\n\nI do see that from an external view, I am in my best shape physically, living a very lucky life and should enjoy it. But I suppose as a teen we don't always recognise what we have until its gone, but I'll try my best to enjoy the peaceful aspect of my life now rather than the anxious, feeling trapped part."

Even when we feel stupid or lack grades, we still posses the skills and the motivation to do something about it. Maybe utilise your feelings to focus harder on improving those grades. \n\nAs for feeling disciplined and useless, I totally get that. I feel annoyed sat and being taught by people who are quite frankly just not as motivated or willing as me. Not in a cruel way it’s not my teachers faults ofc but I hate seeing them tell students off when it’s like, hold on you’re the one who’s hardly teaching us and then blaming us? I don’t think we’re useless, I think society’s made us feel useless when in reality what we are experiencing is totally normal for are age. \n\nLike all we see online is people doing stuff, going out to parties etc. but look around like, hardly any 17 year old I’ve seen is going out and partying and the ones who are are still lonely and depressed lmao. \n\nI think we can get through this though, we know eventually it’ll improve and we will enter young adulthood.

I'm honestly not sure what the reason is behind it, maybe its like idk a chemical imbalance, which is sometimes what I think I have."

        "body": "Wow, I can only imagine how much that frustrates and upsets you. Plus being trans is just so challenging, I can imagine the NHS makes you go through a whole long process and all sorts of bs. \n\nLet me tell you though, coming from someone who is 17, let's say my University experience is bad, I get out at 21. My life's far from over and yours isn't over as well, you are 21!!!! Okay, you wasted teen years, hardly anybody actually enjoys being a teen btw, I had fun often, but I never sat there going \"I love being a teen!\".\n\nBeing like 50+ years is old in my views, and even then you can still do so much. You are 21, you're literally a young adult, you have all the time in the world to make friends, to transition, to talk, to do things. Don't let people tell you to wasted all your \"good years\", you have another 20 good years before you even start getting wrinkles. \n\n21 is literally so young, I'm going to keep saying it but you have all the time in the world right now!! Don't live in regret and don't let regret shape your future, you have so much ahead of you if you don't let your regret and worries shadow over you. Being trans is obviously very challenging of course, plus the mental health that has come up with that. Have you begun transitioning yet? Or is the NHS so shitty that you haven't, I wouldn't be surprised with our country's healthcare. \n\nBut I really cannot express further the fact that you are still so young and you can make the most of your 20's and if not your 20's then 30's and so on. Life isn't a waste if you don't let it be!!! \n\nIk im younger than you so excuse my twatty motivation efforts but yh, I am sorry for what you've gone through and probably are still going through, that is super challenging."
